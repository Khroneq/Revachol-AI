wavs/Empathy-THOUGHT  KINGDOM OF CONSCIENCE-27.wav|Is it?
wavs/Empathy-THOUGHT  KINGDOM OF CONSCIENCE-29.wav|It is, isn't it?
wavs/Empathy-THOUGHT  KINGDOM OF CONSCIENCE-36.wav|Do you believe the status quo is preferable to chaos and bloodshed?
wavs/Empathy-THOUGHT  KINGDOM OF CONSCIENCE-49.wav|The Kingdom is difficult to comprehend and even more difficult to describe...
wavs/Empathy-THOUGHT  KINGDOM OF CONSCIENCE-50.wav|Slow down, Mr. Reasonable! Did you miss the part about compromising and taking things slow?
wavs/Empathy-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-25.wav|Huge lack of enthusiasm going on in here.
wavs/Empathy-HQ  EXIT BULLET difficult-52.wav|Holding the bullet, you get the feeling, this isn't ammunition against you. It's for herself.
wavs/Empathy-HQ  EXIT BULLET difficult-60.wav|Think what you want, but, in your gut, you know otherwise.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  MAINFRAME-247.wav|Doesn't it get lonely, sitting there all by herself?
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  MAINFRAME-351.wav|That's why she does this.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  TIAGO-159.wav|There's a profound longing in that gaze. Like he wants to be one with whatever is up there, shrouded in darkness.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  TIAGO-263.wav|He said that in spite of himself. He's more attached to the human than he'd like to think.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  TIAGO-479.wav|There are drugs darker than alcohol circling your system.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-134.wav|Despite her fear she was hoping for something extraordinary to take place.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-216.wav|It's not the anodic dance music that's made her bitter... it's the failure of Fortress Accident.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-222.wav|There's not a trace of irony in her voice. She means it.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-242.wav|This is clearly a painful topic for her. She must have had to explain herself numerous times.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-314.wav|There's caution in his voice.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-375.wav|In his mind, a tidal wave approaching from afar, swallowing entire coastlines on its way... salvation.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-414.wav|She doesn't seem surprised to be recognized, rather sad. Something passes over her face before she straightens her back.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-595.wav|Miss Know-It-All is hesitating.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-731.wav|It's almost as if she feels some sort of ownership of the fridge.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-812.wav|She sounds mildly annoyed by this line of questioning, her hands typing hundreds of commands into the machine.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-865.wav|That it wasn't her fault. Or theirs.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-939.wav|An intellectual hunger fills her now, casting fear aside.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-1001.wav|It hurts a bit for her to say this, she's not too happy to be parting with the Kvalsund.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-1032.wav|She liked telling you this. It calmed her nerves.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  SOONA-1068.wav|She's beaming, you can feel it in your heart.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  STAINED GLASS WINDOW VISCAL-115.wav|There it is again, a small pang of guilt. It's time to ask him what happened here.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  STAINED GLASS WINDOW VISCAL-116.wav|A pang of guilt? The lieutenant is leaving something out.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  STAINED GLASS WINDOW VISCAL-198.wav|There is silence in the church. He wants there to be.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  STAINED GLASS WINDOW VISCAL-326.wav|An imperceptible tinge of fear. The lieutenant is afraid of this place.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH  STAINED GLASS WINDOW VISCAL-331.wav|An imperceptible tinge of fear. The lieutenant is afraid of the church. He does not know why, but he is.
wavs/Empathy-CHURCH ORB  cone of silence-48.wav|His detached tone conceals how uncomfortable he is.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-18.wav|She doesn't know what to make of that. But she'll remember it.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-134.wav|She is unfazed by your questions. She would consider it impolite to point out any perceived weirdness.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-140.wav|A sudden gush of wind turns the pages of the books on the counters. She covers her face, smiling, but she's cold.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-196.wav|She doesn't really understand, but says so to make you feel better about yourself. Your explanation was garbage anyway.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-225.wav|Dark, arrogant, violent. Likely overcompensating for something.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-405.wav|She knows where this is going.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-489.wav|You disappointed a small child. Well done, champ.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-678.wav|What could you do to help her anyway?
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  ANNETTE-700.wav|You just can't win.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-199.wav|She doesn't mean to be antagonistic, but she can't help coming off defensive.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-223.wav|He's totally missing.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-232.wav|She has though. The husband is totally lost. You should tell her that it's okay.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-312.wav|She's getting upset. Her voice has risen, as she tries to convince herself that her daughters are safe.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-326.wav|There's something else hiding in her voice though, a trace of worry.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-396.wav|She doesn't really want to be disturbed that much...
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-462.wav|It is clear from her voice that she is shattered.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-491.wav|There. She's worried now.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-494.wav|She's thinking about him out in the cold, in some park or on the coast, and it's making her more and more worried.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-503.wav|She doesn't want you to be the fuckupatoo.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  COIN-OPERATED VIEWER I-25.wav|Its leaves ripped from it by the winter wind...
wavs/Empathy-COAST ORB  feldwindows-14.wav|This partner of his, Eyes, things didn't end well. It saddens him to say his name. Don't even ask. He wouldn't answer. Maybe some other small talk?
wavs/Empathy-COAST ORB  redchairconvo-14.wav|He sounds a little worried. It's an odd habit.
wavs/Empathy-COAST ORB  laughingatscene-16.wav|Somehow he doesn't want to dwell on it...
wavs/Empathy-BACKYARD  MOTHER OF ALL WALLS-2.wav|He sounds tired of it all.
wavs/Empathy-GARYS APARTMENT  COLONIAL MUG COLLECTION-10.wav|The images betray a lack of interest in human beings. They are merely unflattering caricatures.
wavs/Empathy-GARYS APARTMENT  COLONIAL MUG COLLECTION-23.wav|The owner of these mugs doesn't like people of other ethnicities very much.
wavs/Empathy-GARYS APARTMENT  COLONIAL MUG COLLECTION-28.wav|This person is unhappy.
wavs/Empathy-GARYS APARTMENT  COLONIAL MUG COLLECTION-29.wav|Of course. So very free.
wavs/Empathy-GARYS APARTMENT  COLONIAL MUG COLLECTION-30.wav|Anytime.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  ROSEMARY-32.wav|His tone is aggressive. You're getting on his bad side now.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  ROSEMARY-211.wav|... and the lieutenant is annoyed.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL-301.wav|Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL-1034.wav|It's not meant as a joke. He's sorry for the Hermit Cop.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL-1045.wav|You of all people should empathize with this. Perhaps this lost jacket is something you could help with...
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL-1104.wav|It's more like you were cramping theirs.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  VILLAGE AND JACKET-118.wav|A warm smile.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA ORB  torque talk-73.wav|Whatever high-school bullying memories you woke in your colleague, he doesn't enjoy them.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA ORB  torque talk-96.wav|He seems to like the idea.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA ORB  torque talk-150.wav|Saying these words brings him immense joy.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA ORB  torque talk-151.wav|Wow... he's not happy you called him a binoclard. He'll get over it.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-5.wav|You can hear resentment in her tone, she's not thrilled to be talking to you again.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-21.wav|No, don't push her. It sounds as if she's about to cry.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-77.wav|Yes. You have obviously done something to upset her, at the Whirling-in-Rags, when she was still working there.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-136.wav|Her voice is resigned and weak.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-195.wav|Not a spinster, my god!
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-199.wav|Think you can do that, Lieutenant Love?
wavs/alternative-0-Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-199-0.wav|Think you can do that, Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Love?. 
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-204.wav|Oh yeah. My point exactly. You know how they are, transactional and hysteric. Loony broads.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-263.wav|There's genuine sadness in her voice.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-441.wav|He sounds worried, yet ready to assist. This is how people get when the police call.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  STATION CALL-445.wav|He didn't actually expect that answer.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  CALLING THE LIBRARY-46.wav|And then goes for a little drink later, on the lookout...
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  LAZARETH CALL-58.wav|A bit of both. But don't flatter yourself, he's not sorry for you.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  LAZARETH CALL-59.wav|Don't flatter yourself, he's not going to miss you.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA  LAZARETH CALL-155.wav|You're detecting very little in the way of empathy from Dr. Gottlieb.
wavs/Empathy-KINEEMA ORB  halogen watermarks-189.wav|It's not a problem for him to state it, however.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-18.wav|There is no bitterness in her voice. She accepted the curiosity her condition inspires a long time ago.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-259.wav|She really would have rather had the pin back, but she doesn't want to make you feel bad.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-318.wav|Your advances haven't thrown her off one bit. In another place and time, she would have probably welcomed your attention.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-331.wav|She really would have rather had the pin back, but she doesn't want to make you feel bad.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-462.wav|I'm just a poor woman, she thinks. What do I know of these things, and how can I help you?
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-477.wav|She really would have rather had the pin back, but she doesn't want to make you feel bad.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-14.wav|A faint smile tells you she appreciates the effort, but at the moment her mind is on more serious matters...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-129.wav|There's a note of disappointment in her voice that she can't quite suppress.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-142.wav|Her smile is weary. Her earlier ebullience has left her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-169.wav|She asked about you because she's afraid to hear about the traps. But that's what she really wants news of.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-289.wav|It's always a challenge to describe the person you know best in the world.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-479.wav|She'd just started forming memories. Real memories, not the billowy haze of infanthood.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-508.wav|And she could get up and walk, right into the reeds on her own. Into the mud. Anywhere.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-549.wav|I'm just a poor woman, she thinks. What do I know of these things. And how can I help you?
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-729.wav|A terrible sting in the heart. Regret.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-831.wav|You haven't, however. There are dangers out there, our ageing bodies fail... her heart won't rest until Morell is safely back with her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-856.wav|She's completely internalized her husband's struggles. They are her own.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-876.wav|A sigh. She doesn't think you'll need it.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-459.wav|Great regret washes over her. A wending cloth.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-196.wav|Maybe you should change it. They were praying... screaming...
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-163.wav|Her opinion of her daughter depends on how well she lured you into the store.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-226.wav|It sounds like both the husband and the mother treat her the way she treats Annette.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-734.wav|Sounds familiar.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-752.wav|Doesn't feel like it's thriving. Feels ghostly.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-800.wav|A part of hers too, clearly.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-806.wav|Yes. Sometimes it's better to let people come to these conclusions themselves.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-807.wav|...my husband is completely different. Of course.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-834.wav|A great, dark relief washes over her.
wavs/Empathy-BOOKSTORE  MAP WALL-67.wav|Lost little pearls of light. Tiny fires in the dark.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-347.wav|Ignore the mock umbrage. Now he wants to prove it to you.
wavs/Empathy-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-73.wav|But he hasn't left yet.
wavs/Empathy-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-214.wav|Please don't go, I'll even stop smoking inside.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-399.wav|Her tone is bitter. She thinks she's been betrayed.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-416.wav|That did make her forgive them, a little.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-487.wav|Gratitude. Doubt. She's still ready to go...
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-566.wav|She died. How can he be so... cold?
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  RUBY'S JOURNAL-156.wav|That must have been one hell of a conversation.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  RUBY'S JOURNAL-181.wav|This was important to her, when it was still hers.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  RUBY'S JOURNAL-183.wav|No, stop... He wouldn't do that.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  RUBY'S JOURNAL-184.wav|No, not even the old you. No you would do that.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-193.wav|She didn't hate him, okay?
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-220.wav|No ill will there. It wasn't a problem for her.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-225.wav|That really comes as a blow to her.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-256.wav|Beneath it, she's relieved Tommy didn't betray her.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-284.wav|Was that... pity? For you? She sees you're grasping for straws here.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR  EXIT DOOR-29.wav|He's quite proud of himself.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-54.wav|She's not telling you all she knows. Keep her talking.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-430.wav|You could follow up on that, but suspect you're not going to pry much out of her.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-514.wav|Like a dog, yes! Loyal and dependable.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-529.wav|He's not dissatisfied with you, but with himself.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-602.wav|She seems genuinely worried about her previous tenant. She's seen her hiding out from trouble before, but this seems different.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-654.wav|It's not that she misses the kids, they've been gone too long for that, but deep deep down the old woman is incurably lonely.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-690.wav|He's a little relieved you're no longer in that room.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-716.wav|He did not like that.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-773.wav|She really means it. It's an honest plea.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  AFTER CRYING KIM-3.wav|You get the feeling you're being handled with kid gloves because your cheeks are still soaking wet.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  NOID-90.wav|The young man is dead serious about this.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  NOID-357.wav|With wonder in his sharp eyes.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  NOID-506.wav|He does not feel left out. In fact he probably just wanted to say "hard core."
wavs/Empathy-ICE  NOID-592.wav|Caustic, overflowing with negativity.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  NOID-697.wav|He's just scared.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  NOID-698.wav|It's not easy for him. It probably took him years to get used to Andre.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE AND ASSOCIATES-87.wav|You can see it must have been a great night. The memory causes her to go silent for a moment or two.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE AND ASSOCIATES-95.wav|A quick response. She's very sure of it. He's someone she feels she can trust and even control, if need be.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE ON ICE-156.wav|The girl is truly proud of herself.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE ON ICE-297.wav|Thinking about it really cheers her up. It's a long way from here, though.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE CHURCH STUFF-23.wav|She doesn't get confused often, but she is definitely confused now.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-5.wav|He's not as glad as he would like you to think. There's concern in his voice.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-31.wav|He looks like he's genuinely sorry he didn't throw them better.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-265.wav|For this man even regular silence is awful enough. But that was... something greater.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  EGGHEAD-93.wav|The young man drops his oversized head in shame. He is truly sorry he couldn't come up with a proletarian yell that would satisfy The Great Leader.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  EGGHEAD-133.wav|For a moment you almost think he's going to put the tape player down. But that would be ludicrous.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  EGGHEAD-271.wav|He feels ashamed he can't be of more service to the future of dance music.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  EGGHEAD-450.wav|For a moment you almost think he's going to put his hand down. But that would be ludicrous.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  EGGHEAD-651.wav|An innocent soul, unaccustomed to acts of wanton guile.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-4.wav|He's waiting to see what you do. For god's sake say you fucked up, please.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-109.wav|He's been anticipating this moment for some time. Still, it doesn't make it any easier for him to say...
wavs/Empathy-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-169.wav|Hold on a moment. Maybe now's not the best time to tell the lieutenant that the world is ending...
wavs/Empathy-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-184.wav|The lieutenant is a rational observer of reality. His worldview can't accommodate this kind of thing.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE-138.wav|He doesn't look resigned at all. Probably counting on your curiosity to get the best of you sooner or later.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE-164.wav|He's not as glad as he would like you to think. There is concern in his voice.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  CHURCH DOOR-38.wav|There is a touch of guilt in his voice.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  CHURCH DOOR-45.wav|He feels sorry for you. For him as a lieutenant it would be demeaning to have someone recite terms from the officer's exam.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  CHURCH DOOR-207.wav|There is a touch of something in his voice. Hard to say what.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-130.wav|Yes, if anything, the lieutenant feels tired. Like a man who's heard the same record one time too many.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-134.wav|He's obviously having trouble adjusting to this new reality.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-152.wav|He's having trouble adjusting to the new reality before him.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-193.wav|He senses something is wrong.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-209.wav|He senses something is wrong.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-235.wav|Underneath, he is furious she ruined it for them. This means trouble for their female friend.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-329.wav|There's resignation in his voice. He's almost ready to drop the act. It wouldn't take a lot of pushing.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-361.wav|The disdain is palpable. His eyes pierce you like lightning, as he lets go of the wallet.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-834.wav|The lieutenant sounds genuinely worried about you, and furious with himself, for not stopping you from running around.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE-8.wav|It's cold out here, but she's not wearing a hat! She must be freezing.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE-82.wav|There is a hint of pity in her eyes.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE-345.wav|Nothing to emote over. You put the device back on the ice.
wavs/alternative-0-Empathy-ICE  ACELE-345-0.wav|Nothing to emote over. You put the device back on the floor.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE-663.wav|It's real. Tell her.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE-683.wav|The kid isn't arrogant, she's just afraid to look you in the eye. You already put her in her place.
wavs/Empathy-ICE  ACELE-726.wav|That's it, you've earned it, start crying, life's hard.
wavs/Empathy-LANDS END  NETPICKER-70.wav|Her thoughts are still elsewhere, with distances across the water, and with the water itself.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  RENE-16.wav|It's a conflicted topic for the old veteran. There must have been a number of controversial episodes in his service days.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  RENE-106.wav|He feels like he has to justify himself for some reason.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  RENE-214.wav|Cautious nature prevents him from voicing more objections, but he will always remember the cop who bullied him, of that you can be sure.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  RENE-332.wav|You can feel the jolly man pull back. This hurt. More than he was ready for.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  RENE-514.wav|Could it be... guilt?
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  GASTON-126.wav|He finds comfort in the thought.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  GASTON-232.wav|He has doubts, but right now he just wants to move on and not think about it.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  GIANT HAM SANDWICH-71.wav|A treat of this magnitude should not be enjoyed alone.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  RIVER CRATER-99.wav|Soon they will forget everything. Him too... Then he chooses anger over melancholy.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA ORB  neither man clicked-42.wav|The lieutenant is thinking of all the time you've spared. He likes it.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  SLEEPING DOCKWORKER-120.wav|He doesn't sound too enthusiastic about this.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GORACY KUBEK-118.wav|They're friends.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GORACY KUBEK-121.wav|He's happy for some reason.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  STEEL DOOR-19.wav|He's not bothered by your eccentricity. He seems genuinely intrigued himself.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE-154.wav|No one has been afraid of you without you knowing. They all felt perfectly safe.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE-155.wav|Everyone felt perfectly safe in your company. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE-329.wav|He sincerely thought it was going to be amusing. For both of you.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE-814.wav|Judging by the familiarity you feel toward him, two years minimum? Or maybe a short, but close stint on the task force...
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-159.wav|This is a very, very sad man who has just seen something that's made him forget his sadness.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-253.wav|He gulps, overcome with awe.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-276.wav|He's genuinely alarmed now.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-309.wav|He's genuinely concerned now.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-912.wav|He appreciated you remembering.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-2.wav|There's an enormous sadness in that admission.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-15.wav|For the world.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-160.wav|His smirk suggests barely contained laughter.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-556.wav|He's genuinely scared of being left behind.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LELY TAPE-71.wav|The contrast feels chilly, inappropriate even.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1 ORB  play pinball-11.wav|The lieutenant grimaces, looking at the machines.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1 ORB  play pinball-78.wav|So that's why he doesn't want to talk to Cuno. Trauma-and-Stressor Disorder from being a juvie cop.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  FOOTPRINTS IN THE DUST-14.wav|This is good. He likes it. That's a little smile there, in the dark of the workshop.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR ORB  dark celebration-57.wav|He's struggling to keep silent, but finally seems to give up.
wavs/Empathy-LAIR ORB  dark celebration 2-82.wav|He's struggling to keep silent, but finally seems to give up.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  WCH-135.wav|He was confused when he died. Confused and alone, most likely. Overcome with the awful surprise of it all.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  TRASH CAN-22.wav|He shakes his head with genuine sadness.
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-68.wav|She means she doesn't have time to tend to your emotions.
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-181.wav|She keeps her shoulders squared and her back straight but it's clear you're still making her sad.
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-226.wav|She avoids turning them to you...
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-394.wav|The weight is you and your hate.
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-400.wav|She's really sorry she made you think like that about her beloved aerodrome.
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-605.wav|You won't do any of that. You can barely make her cry.
wavs/Empathy-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-607.wav|You couldn't make her lungs glow anyway, only cry. And maybe not even that anymore.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-57.wav|She speaks matter-of-factly, but there's a sadness in her voice.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-58.wav|She means it. She wouldn't defy authority, however sweaty and bloated it may look.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-60.wav|She appears to genuinely want you to understand it's okay.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-181.wav|She hates civilization. She feels betrayed by it.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE DOOR-147.wav|He doesn't like where this is going.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  TRASH-24.wav|He's enjoying your little failure. He finds it amusing, he's revelling in the sweaty rage on your face.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  TRASH-278.wav|His eyes express a rare condolence. Then he picks it up:
wavs/Empathy-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-121.wav|He regrets it the moment he says it.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-147.wav|Beneath the mirthless exterior the lieutenant is amused. Although he does not actually think you blew it wide open.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-231.wav|A doubt perhaps? It would be unprofessional of him to be sure of himself at such an early stage of the investigation.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-167.wav|The lieutenant is quite surprised you managed to come up with an adequate case number.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-284.wav|Trying not to bring the incident up any more.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-331.wav|There-there dead man, you were someone's child. It's all over now.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-394.wav|This is clearly what they've been waiting for. Ever since the autopsy began. The lieutenant is trying to make it as boring as possible.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-672.wav|Between the stench of death and the neverending corpse-examination, he's under some stress there. Better not to poke.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-681.wav|The lieutenant's admission has caused great gratitude in Cuno. He is silent with it.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-702.wav|He is deep in thought, eyes fixed on the bright red ring around the dead man's neck.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-794.wav|He's thinking: Did I miss something?
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-1029.wav|He doesn't actually think it's 'interesting' that the boots have disappeared, it's just sad, sad and unprofessional.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN-117.wav|You're sure this has not affected his impression of you in a good way.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN-366.wav|He's not actually sure of that. He's just being tactful.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN-928.wav|This isn't mere boundary pushing. There is a true suicidal rage in the kid as she's provoking you.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN-964.wav|He's definitely not impressed by the way you're handling it, but he doesn't hold it against you either. He's supportive like that.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN-1226.wav|What was that? Was the lieutenant just impressed by your unintuitive guess?
wavs/Empathy-YARD  HANGED MAN BULLET-40.wav|Quivering with awe.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-86.wav|He's not mad, that smelly mess of paper in your hand is making him worry about the well being of his own paperwork, that's all.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-100.wav|He's sorry for you.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-136.wav|The lieutenant would rather not have you rummaging around, looking for the lights in his vehicle...
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-142.wav|The lieutenant fears this will lead to fiddling with the delicate, folding headlights on his motor carriage. They're dear to him.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-195.wav|The threat has passed. He is thankful it has passed, and that he's gotten to keep both pens.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-583.wav|He really likes that name.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-678.wav|It actually. Does. You've offended him.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-778.wav|Strange? Why does it make you so angry?
wavs/Empathy-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-141.wav|It must be cold and lonely down there, in the icy water.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  BADGE-168.wav|He trusts you, for now. Try not to spoil it.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  BADGE-169.wav|Still, he doesn't trust you completely.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-5.wav|His courtesy is not insincere, but he prefers being alone with his projector, just watching the movement of light across the walls of the shop.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-26.wav|There's a note of indignation in his voice. Interesting.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-88.wav|He's doubtful, but doesn't see the point in contradicting a notion that is so dear to you.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-128.wav|He's not telling you the whole story. It seems he's trying to spare you.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-521.wav|There's a 'but', isn't there? There's always a 'but'.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-523.wav|Looks like he really means it.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-527.wav|A guarded man like him wouldn't tell you if you asked out loud.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-534.wav|So much bitterness.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-540.wav|The windfall is a small consolation.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  ROY-616.wav|Miraculously, his face does not reveal what's happening inside.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  PAWNSHOP-13.wav|It pains him to see a fellow officer struggling to make ends meet and not be able to offer assistance. This is his way of making it up to you.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  PAWNSHOP-25.wav|He's not too comfortable counselling you like this, but he's genuinely concerned for your well-being.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  RACK OF SECOND-HAND UNIFORMS-46.wav|Their matter-of-fact tone belies their surprise at the fact that you didn't recognize the figure in the print.
wavs/Empathy-PAWNSHOP  RACK OF SECOND-HAND UNIFORMS-47.wav|He's surprised at your non-recognition.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-24.wav|She is unfazed by your rudeness, probably chocking it up to local custom.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-208.wav|Laced with just a touch of pity.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-254.wav|There's a trace of irony in his voice. Mischief even. The lieutenant is hatching some scheme.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-261.wav|There is no shame in her voice, a touch of sadness, yes, but no shame.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-287.wav|The lieutenant is satisfied with where this is going.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-324.wav|Her concern is sincere, her eyes round and affectionate.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-608.wav|Awkwardness washes over the conversation. The woman doesn't like this turn of events.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-813.wav|She's trying to conceal her excitement, but the slight glimmer in her green eyes tells you otherwise.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-946.wav|She understands what you're trying to do, ask for money. But shame is contagious and she doesn't want to offend you by saying it out loud.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-967.wav|She's surprisingly nonchalant about this. If anything, your finally asking it has relieved some of the tension.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-968.wav|She's surprisingly nonchalant about this. Could it be that she somehow knows more about your predicament than she's letting on?
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1288.wav|Her smile is bitter. There is no cure.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1468.wav|She doesn't like it. Probably a bad memory. Mean girls at school or some ancient lover...
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-22.wav|Your response does not inspire great faith in the RCM.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-192.wav|You don't know how you know, it's not written on her face, nor in her voice, but she had sympathy for this man.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-255.wav|She has no excess of emotions for this cadaver. Has she seen dead bodies before? It's likely.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-335.wav|It could go this or the other way. Maybe if you're tactful, it could be beneficial?
wavs/Empathy-PIER  CINDY-101.wav|The bemusement in her voice doesn't fully mask genuine tenderness.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  CINDY-345.wav|If there's pain about any particular home she's lost, she's buried it deep, fortified herself against it.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  CINDY-423.wav|The wannabe-SKULLS are dear to her. The armour less so.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  CINDY-444.wav|She did it herself. Pumped it out. She's proud of it, too.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  CINDY-445.wav|She really did it. She's proud of it, too.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  CINDY-452.wav|Damn me and my affinity to farm animals, she's probably thinking. She hopes the information is useless.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  JOYCE DRUGS-22.wav|He doesn't let it show, but there is a limit to how much the consequences of your unprofessional behaviour can cost the investigation.
wavs/Empathy-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-109.wav|From the looks of it the Fifties haven't been much better for the Zone of Control, you can see it in her eyes. Days slipping away....
wavs/Empathy-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-137.wav|She's not gloating. It's a relieved celebration.
wavs/Empathy-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-300.wav|There is bitterness in her voice, tempered with understanding. She is critical, but ultimately understands the cause.
wavs/Empathy-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-344.wav|No. The tiny apes are doing all they can to be better. It's not their fault.
wavs/Empathy-PIER ORB  searails-25.wav|He does not like talking politics of this kind.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  JOYCE-69.wav|You detect a note of longing in her voice.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-26.wav|This person is not easily disoriented, but you've done it.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-174.wav|A brief spike of longing in her upright body. The dots under her eyelids shake.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-328.wav|She conveys it in short, cold bursts, trying not to invest too deeply in the condition of this doomed detective.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-516.wav|There is regret in her voice, for all the countless things she never had time to do with her money.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-558.wav|She does not seem convinced that you'll be fine. If anything, she is realizing how deep your condition runs.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-590.wav|Was he just... worried? That you would find out something awful?
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-602.wav|He truly, truly doesn't want you to know.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-779.wav|Perhaps that explains her strange pining after the Revolution? Some degraded early memories...
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-131.wav|A strange equanimity has overtaken the lieutenant. He's just going with the flow now. Easier that way.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-230.wav|With longing... clear and simple longing. Strange. Why does she want to go there?
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-267.wav|Oh no, she's sentimental all right.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-275.wav|Oh no, she's sentimental all right. Why would she come here otherwise?
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-411.wav|His arm rises for a second, as if he's about to put it on your shoulder. He doesn't, but the intention was there...
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-486.wav|Despite his words he's not really sure whether to be annoyed with you or not.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-632.wav|Are you not afraid it'll kill him?
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-765.wav|This is good. It pleases her.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-880.wav|There's turmoil in there now, but still she keeps it in check.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-905.wav|Look who's defensive suddenly.
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-909.wav|This gave her pause. She's pensive, suddenly. Hard to say about what...
wavs/Empathy-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-922.wav|She would die to return to it. The pale. The past. Anything one can return to.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-312.wav|He sounds surprisingly weary.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-437.wav|This is not the first person to die in his place. He goes on.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-510.wav|He's made his peace with it. He's had the time to do so.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-107.wav|Wow... Cuno's about to take pity on you. That's unexpected.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-111.wav|Wow... the kid's name must be Cuno. And he's about to take pity on you.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-148.wav|Tough he may be, but this image left a mark.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-237.wav|Asking for something, even asking to come along, doesn't come easy for him.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-248.wav|Look, this might be his only way out.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-259.wav|Wow, he did not take that rejection well.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-260.wav|Wow, he did not take that rejection well.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-345.wav|He doesn't have anyone in the world.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  KIM PAPERWORK-66.wav|He's right, you know? The lieutenant probably doesn't enjoy being called a binoclard, the four-eyed dork.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  GRAFFITO-50.wav|The flames warmed him too. Not at all in a bad way.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-212.wav|He really hates the Hardie boys. Laying off speed for a few days hasn't changed that. Titus ignoring him doesn't help either.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-233.wav|There's a lump in his throat when he thinks of Glen, lying on the plaza mosaic, bleeding.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-235.wav|Here it comes. The last one is the worst one. He only deals with it by drinking copious amounts of 8% beer.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  EUGENE AND ALAIN-165.wav|He really means it.
wavs/Empathy-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-69.wav|You know who isn't old, drunk, or dead? Lilienne.
wavs/Empathy-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-138.wav|Being put in the spotlight like this makes him feel exposed, makes him lash out.
wavs/Empathy-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-144.wav|Just don't ask him about it. Boys in that age can be quite sensitive about such matters.
wavs/Empathy-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-196.wav|A truly rare moment of self pity.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-235.wav|Tugging at his heart strings like that... doesn't it feel a bit manipulative?
wavs/Empathy-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-247.wav|The air between you becomes a little awkward as it becomes clear you don't know the first thing about bribes.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-296.wav|The air between you becomes a little awkward as it becomes clear you don't know the first thing about bribes.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  LORRY CONCLUSIONS-39.wav|Actually, he's not bad at it at all.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  PALEDRIVER-121.wav|The smile on her face has disappeared, replaced by the wary aspect of a cornered beast.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  PALEDRIVER-178.wav|She seems to derive some bitter pleasure from this strange thought. As if the past will one day wipe the present away, like a tidal wave approaching.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  PALEDRIVER-240.wav|He's worried. But not for her, for you. Hmm. What is it about this woman, if she's not connected to anything?
wavs/Empathy-JAM  PALEDRIVER-376.wav|Nostalgia. Cooped up in the cabin, shaking... Terrible nostalgia. For yourself. For humans. It's too much to bear. She loves it.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  PALEDRIVER-400.wav|There is nothing more to do now. She's far away.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  RACIST-142.wav|Usually he says it with derision, but to you he seems to say it as an actual greeting.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  RACIST-148.wav|You sense slight embarrassment for the outburst. Or is it pride? Impossible to tell.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  RACIST-538.wav|Looks like you got his adrenaline up too.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-70.wav|If it is, then why the melancholy?
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-447.wav|She seems genuinely sorry for not being able to help you.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-481.wav|A gush of sadness suddenly washes over her.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-522.wav|This is neither a touchy nor a very interesting topic for her.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-587.wav|She didn't appreciate your cold rationality.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-604.wav|He liked the Coupris funeral idea.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-640.wav|Great, now you reminded her of the husband.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-724.wav|You made her sad. She actually really wanted to go.
wavs/Empathy-VILLAGE  LITTLE LILY-107.wav|She doesn't want you to think she stole them.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO-280.wav|You're a little bit closer now to understanding this kid.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO-323.wav|He means it. He really does want to calm down.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-135.wav|He seems glad someone understood what he was going for, but right as he's getting distracted, you hear a malevolent hiss from behind the fence...
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-136.wav|The boy knows he has an addictive personality. Admirable insight for his age.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-203.wav|He's having the time of his life. Total ecstasy. Fuck the pig.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-285.wav|She understands: The battle for the control over Cuno is a battle of madness against madness. For the time being, her madness has proven less potent.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-413.wav|This pleases him.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-476.wav|He's disappointed by your change of heart.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-2.wav|It's not Cuno. It's Cunoesse.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-30.wav|What's going on? He's an ungovernable youth on your crime scene, throwing around incendiary language, trying to push your buttons.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-55.wav|That went wrong. He took it as a compliment. Then he had a minor seizure.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-56.wav|Normal is not what we got here. You've got to work with what you have for now.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-57.wav|Smelling weakness. She loves it.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-58.wav|You have no idea what to say now. You're just going to have to try to change the subject...
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-61.wav|All in all, Cuno respects madness. You cannot hope to outdo her on that front. You must win yourself a few minutes with him alone.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-73.wav|He's whispering too. He's going with it. But watch what happens...
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-76.wav|This is it, you've got him. But be careful, you can still fuck this up. Don't make Cuno look bad in this.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-83.wav|She understands what you're trying to do.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-87.wav|You did it. They're separated. He's even turned his back to her so she can't read his lips.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-89.wav|Wrong move. But he's whispering still. You haven't lost him, just don't mess up again, or you will. There are no guarantees here.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-235.wav|This is what it all comes down to, he needs you to take him seriously now.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-240.wav|She won.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO LOCUSTS-7.wav|She sounds like she's about to cry out of disappointment at Cuno's newfound lameness.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO LOCUSTS-110.wav|There's silence between the two children. They're not saying anything to each other nor looking in each other's direction.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO SPEED-121.wav|There is a touch of grief in there.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO SPEED-212.wav|A small lump forming in his throat.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO SPEED-216.wav|In truth, Cuno doesn't really believe there's anything you can do to make up for this. The damage is irreparable.
wavs/Empathy-YARD  CUNO SPEED-296.wav|She tries to bind their fates together. She needs him. Bad.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-64.wav|I don't want to.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-71.wav|I don't want to do this.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-84.wav|Too late, you ruined it, just say it now.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-89.wav|Too late, you ruined it, just say it now.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-154.wav|RCM? I wish Kim was here...
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-186.wav|You've done this before. Just keep your focus.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-243.wav|You know the answer to this. Oddly, you just do.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-270.wav|He must feel vulnerable without his glasses. Is this why he's letting you take the lead?
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-307.wav|Do something? Break something? It's a fool's hope.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-308.wav|It reminded him of his teenage years.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-311.wav|Yes. That's the most important thing. Use that word.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-316.wav|If you say 'Two days, maybe', it will be etched in her mind forever.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-317.wav|But he was just here. Alive.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-328.wav|There has been enough pain.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-332.wav|He was just here. Alive.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW MAIN-358.wav|What are you still doing here?! She needs time to be alone now.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-631.wav|Your partner's doing you a favour by pretending not to have heard your insane ramblings.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-646.wav|Did he love it before they made him do it again and again and again?
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-733.wav|Well, that wasn't pretty, but you do seem to have taken the heat off Klaasje, for now.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-746.wav|You're dooming a young woman in her hour of desperation.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-747.wav|Stop! Before you do anything, consider the consequences.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-752.wav|Have you thought about what this might mean for Klaasje?
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-757.wav|It's your call.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-763.wav|That's it. She's done for. Au revoir, Klaasje.
wavs/Empathy-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-778.wav|Do you not care for anyone other than yourself? Have you thought about what this might mean for Klaasje?
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW DOOR-23.wav|There's fear in her voice.
wavs/Empathy-APT  WCW DOOR-63.wav|Good advice.
wavs/Empathy-APT  MAZOV DOOR-66.wav|He's just trying to help, don't take it... bad. Relax.
wavs/Empathy-APT  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-26.wav|It feels like a Friday. He seems to be in a good mood tonight.
wavs/Empathy-APT  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-73.wav|It's laughter!
wavs/Empathy-APT  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-75.wav|There, he's laughing again!
wavs/Empathy-APT  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-108.wav|It feels like a Friday. He seems to be in a good mood today.
wavs/Empathy-APT  CLEANING LADY-57.wav|You're still worried. It's very worrying.
wavs/Empathy-APT  CLEANING LADY-108.wav|It didn't get physical. She heard something she doesn't want to hear again.
wavs/Empathy-APT  CLEANING LADY-158.wav|With how small these rooms are, wouldn't you want to break the wall down?
wavs/Empathy-APT  CLEANING LADY-170.wav|She's seen it, and known those who have been killed.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DEAD HUSBAND-50.wav|He's avoiding your gaze. This is the time to say how sorry you are about how things went.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-64.wav|There is a sudden, harsh edge to his voice. Like he's tired of hearing about your "personal affairs."
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-102.wav|His disdain is clear. This man would not use such an expression otherwise.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-216.wav|He does not actually think it was a good joke.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-443.wav|Maybe this is why your chest feels so hollow, you did an awful thing, and you can't even bring yourself to acknowledge it...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-492.wav|He is glad and surprised to see an officer who can appreciate the less-than spectacular.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-617.wav|Fortunately he is a committed officer of the RCM. He'll only use his powers for the good of the investigation.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-742.wav|He's glad to have shot down your question.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-796.wav|That's where his conversations with himself take place.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-809.wav|Maybe this is why your chest feels so hollow, you did an awful thing, and you can't even bring yourself to acknowledge it...
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-128.wav|He says it matter-of-factly and moves on.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-345.wav|Kim must have had doubts about his name at some point too, but deliberately discarded them.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-484.wav|It's more than that. There's some kind of affection in him.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-490.wav|The lieutenant breathes out a chestnut-scented cloud of cigarette smoke and looks at the city he's sworn to guard.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-542.wav|Thanks, kid, he thinks. He's grateful.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  END OF DAY-16.wav|Though he finds this situation frustrating, he is doing his best to not make you feel any worse than you already do.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  END OF DAY-33.wav|He's proud of you for getting your act together and finding a way to pay back what you owe.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  DAY TWO UNION-11.wav|He kind of wishes you'd acknowledged his contribution, but you've missed your opportunity now.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-63.wav|You will never be able to experience it the way she does. She's even a bit sad about it; then the feeling passes.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-306.wav|His tone is friendly now and the last words are actually accompanied with a little smile.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-403.wav|Neither one of us will ever get it off completely.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-14.wav|The shrug is disingenuous. He's intrigued, if only for a moment.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-26.wav|The shrug is disingenuous. He's intrigued, if only for a moment.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-32.wav|It's said without aggression, as genuine advice.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-44.wav|It's said without aggression. In good trust.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-195.wav|He's clearly been in solitary confinement, and at a young age, nonetheless.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-214.wav|She probably knows you're not welcome there... somehow she does.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-311.wav|He regrets mentioning it, hopes you didn't notice.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-410.wav|His 'all muscle' comment wasn't sarcastic. He's genuinely trying to look out for Angus.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-448.wav|He's grateful. Just a little, somewhere down there. You didn't force him to get ugly.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-470.wav|Beneath everything he's grateful, just a bit. You don't force him to get ugly.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-482.wav|Beneath everything he's just a little bit grateful you didn't force him to get ugly.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-538.wav|This one has a special gripe with him coming here.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-559.wav|There's slight unease in him, suddenly. He regrets mentioning the rape.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-105.wav|There's less gusto in his voice now. His men too are growing increasingly silent.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-161.wav|Why is Goldmouth mean to him? Something is wrong. It doesn't look like he's succeeding.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-516.wav|Right now he's grateful he hasn't gotten his brother into this mess.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  ADDITIONAL CONTENT-86.wav|The children kept her together.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-178.wav|Bullseye! Glen looks around uncomfortably. The lieutenant hit a nerve.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-272.wav|They're only pretending to enjoy this. Beneath the act, they don't like you knowing this.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-243.wav|He is infinitely grateful to have that gun back on his belt right now.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-280.wav|Something is off here. His anger is... possessive.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1   MERC TRIBUNAL WARNING-16.wav|Titus did his best, but his men are a bit unsettled.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-287.wav|It's clear this one is protective of her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-407.wav|Right there, underneath the calm and the cool, a nervousness. He's thinking: Ruby could have fucked us all over. How did I not see it?
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-909.wav|It's not a threat, it's a warning.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-678.wav|Not even a speck of anger in his voice. That's that then.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-688.wav|It saddens him, that she can. Sours it, but only a tiny bit.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-11.wav|The look in his deep blue eyes is as sincere as you've ever seen. Kind of makes you feel like an asshole for no apparent reason.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-80.wav|He really feels very uncomfortable discussing matters related to Evrart with you.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-111.wav|The white rectangle on your clothes might not mean an awful lot in Martinaise, but the recognition from an authority figure made Leo's day.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-142.wav|For a fraction of a second there's sadness in his eyes.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-261.wav|There is true indignation in his voice when he speaks about the state of things. And even a touch of pain.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-277.wav|He crosses his hands, contently, thinking of the interior temperature of the wasp rising.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-296.wav|It sounds like a very disturbed and desperate individual.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-217.wav|Despite his boastful tone, he's having doubts about something, but what?
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-295.wav|He's clearly happy about the tribunal.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-441.wav|He means it.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-492.wav|If he's just boasting then it sure doesn't feel like that to you. He's not worried.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-144.wav|He speaks from the heart. He has very different problems compared to low-net-worth individuals such as yourself. For example, no problems at all.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-158.wav|This is a proposal, not a question.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-198.wav|A place to teach them practical skills like teamwork and self-discipline.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-18.wav|He seems happy about the prospect of you telling Joyce about your conversations.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-74.wav|Yes, he really doesn't seem to mind.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-144.wav|If it's spilled blood you're looking for then there certainly isn't any in his expression, or demeanour now.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  CLOAK JUMP-134.wav|The look in his eyes is a mix of the engineer-like interest and the wonder of a six year old seeing a horse for the first time.
wavs/Empathy-CONTAINERYARD  CLOAK JUMP-198.wav|He's thinking you've forgotten where you are again.
wavs/Empathy-CARGO  NIGHT WATCHMAN BOOTH-68.wav|The young man looks happy as well. He's about to smile, right after this moment frozen in time. You're sure of that.
wavs/Empathy-OFFICE  PUNCHCLOCK AND PHONE-48.wav|He thinks you're pulling a prank on him.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  mailbox-45.wav|Dodged the bullet there... He must see the box as the weaker of the two, and you as a bully, something he doesn't stand for.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  mailbox-46.wav|He must see the box as the weaker of the two, and you as a bully, something he doesn't stand for.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-120.wav|There's discomfort. She stops mid sentence.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-177.wav|She would probably prefer not to go into it. It wasn't easy to pick up on either...
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-207.wav|She's relieved someone has come for it, finally.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-219.wav|She seems more perplexed than threatened.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-243.wav|She's not okay with it. It's a display of power and she feels threatened by it. You don't know why.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-359.wav|She seems more perplexed than cornered.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-409.wav|She's uncomfortable. Maybe you should drop this line of questioning.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-279.wav|It's a sigh of relief.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-321.wav|He liked how you decisively shut down a situation that could have turned into a farce.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-344.wav|He did not appreciate you undermining his authority in front of the two punks.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-429.wav|Like murder. Or wasting your life away.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-447.wav|It's true. He simply can't, it's called empathy.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-470.wav|You got it. No need for cruelty.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  ELECTRONIC DOORBELL-254.wav|Real or not, your mirror neurons react: it feels painful to be listening to this.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  HIDDEN WEAPONS CACHE-59.wav|He likes this find.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-257.wav|Doesn't it get lonely, sitting there all by herself?
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-445.wav|That's why she does this.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  CURTAINS-48.wav|A sudden bout of self pity comes over you.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  FREQUENCY FIREPLACE-47.wav|All of this gone, left unrealized.
wavs/Empathy-KIM SWITCH  FORTRESS ACCIDENT-49.wav|He has respect, and curiosity, for this failed endeavour.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-904.wav|She's not sorry to disappoint you. Informing on someone in a murder investigation would intrude upon her focused existence.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-918.wav|Poor guy... suddenly you get a feeling that insects are important to the case somehow. It's hard to say why.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-922.wav|She liked them.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-924.wav|Something strains her face, before she looks up again:
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-934.wav|His disdain for pinball could not be clearer.
wavs/Empathy-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-959.wav|She's thankful for the security they provide her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-162.wav|Something changes in her. It's pity. Pity comes over her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-183.wav|Then something changes in her. It's pity. Pity comes over her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-69.wav|It's a mere second, but it feels like you saw something... a gram of compassion in that sadness.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-197.wav|He's trying to protect you from further rough handling dished out by this sun-glassed man.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-242.wav|None of this is great news for him.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-147.wav|C'mon, you know why.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-162.wav|It looks like she does not want to pick it up, Harry. Stop scaring her.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-379.wav|He accepts your apology.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-388.wav|The saddest sound in the world.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 3-3.wav|Every cell in your body is moaning in agony, asking,  "What did we ever do to you?"
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 3-56.wav|Maybe if you weren't so hard on yourself...
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  MORELL-198.wav|Whatever he thinks about this detour, it's clear that these men are exhausted and in need of assistance.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  MORELL-636.wav|Is that a pang of sadness, lieutenant?
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  MORELL-699.wav|He's still glad his friend stood up for him.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  MORELL-715.wav|A sigh. She doesn't think you'll need it.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  GARY-172.wav|He's disappointed in you and sees no point of arguing further.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  GARY-174.wav|He's disappointed in you and sees no point of arguing further.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  GARY-505.wav|He clearly liked his squirming. He may even have changed his mind about the whole door-opening operation.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  GARY-540.wav|He's a loyal friend.
wavs/Empathy-WESTCOAST  MORELL CRYPTIDS-208.wav|He's a good and loyal man despite his ramblings, the elderly cryptozoologist thinks to himself.
wavs/Empathy-KIM ORB  seolite conspiracy-37.wav|Isn't that what you've always wanted, to be listened to?
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-74.wav|In her mind you're under control now, the next moment you're not. It appears the things she says are very real to her, as long as she's saying them.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-79.wav|In her mind the cavity search is happening, as long as she's saying it. It appears the things she says are very real to her.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-142.wav|What happened to make her like this?
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-146.wav|So this is what the weather's like on the other end of a cop's gun?
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-267.wav|So that's how Cunoesse must have felt, when you pointed the gun at her.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-271.wav|So that's how Cunoesse must have felt... right before you fired a shot at her.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-287.wav|He's grateful you did this.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-207.wav|Wait. What does this man know about pyrholidon addiction?
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-281.wav|Perhaps reminded of a childhood memory? It's clear he would prefer there were a big wheel lighting up the coast.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-292.wav|There's something friendly and familiar in how he says that. A day off.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-161.wav|She looks devastated.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-208.wav|He's trying not to think about how bad it could have been had the gun been loaded.
wavs/Empathy-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-252.wav|Exactly. With only the voice of Gareth Morrand to accompany her on Channel 8.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-51.wav|That must be her tell: the cigarette. It hurts her to look directly at the corpse so she reverts her gaze to you.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-56.wav|This does not come as good news to him.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-230.wav|The woman doesn't flinch, but there is something in her light brown eyes... a sadness.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-234.wav|The woman doesn't flinch, but there is something in her eyes, the same sadness? Yes, from when she first told you about the hanging, in the hallway.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-355.wav|It's the world's most tired smile.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-375.wav|Her voice is indifferent to the number.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-460.wav|She doesn't seem to be overly distressed. Or distressed at all, really.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-468.wav|Playfully. She doesn't seem to be overly distressed. Or distressed at all, really.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-587.wav|He finds the answer unsatisfying.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-609.wav|Behind it is deep, boundless gratitude.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-651.wav|Something in her demeanour has changed. She's tired, consigned to her fate, to being here with you and what's to come.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-679.wav|She's lost in thought, eyes narrowed, forehead furrowed...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-699.wav|A jitter of fear and disgust moves through her body, beginning from her shoulders and ending in her hips. The cigarette tastes foul to her now.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-733.wav|She smiles. A bitter little smile. She means it.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-763.wav|He feels uncomfortable with this conversation. He doesn't know what to add.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-1035.wav|There is something in her eyes, the same sadness? Yes, from back in the hallway when she first told you about the hanging, in the hallway.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-1036.wav|There is something in her light brown eyes... a sadness. When she thinks about the death of that man.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F2  MEDICINE CABINET-166.wav|This toothbrush belongs to someone who doesn't give a damn about her teeth.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-222.wav|For a second he seems... tired.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  BARRED DOOR-98.wav|She sounds genuinely curious.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  BARRED DOOR-103.wav|It totally was.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-88.wav|You get the feeling she might be.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-111.wav|She sincerely thinks it's very cool of you.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-187.wav|With longing. She misses him.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-235.wav|You wonder... is it enough to...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-236.wav|It hurts her. But does it hurt enough to...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-243.wav|She hunches her shoulders a bit, making herself smaller.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-443.wav|A gleeful smile. She's pretty happy that your partner's not here.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-726.wav|Tearing off his armour, demeaning him, throwing rocks at him...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-730.wav|She's just tired. Don't push her too much.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-24.wav|She is not at all worried the tape will contradict her statement.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-225.wav|She doesn't mind this questioning. On the contrary, she enjoys thinking back to him now. This is a sort of wake for her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-270.wav|She's clearly sensing something. A spike in testosterone levels, perhaps.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-409.wav|She agrees.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-643.wav|It isn't much closure, but it is enough. She is ready to talk about him now.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-689.wav|This does not surprise her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-141.wav|Run, woman! Run past them and out into the street where it's dark and people move, to the lorries at the intersection. As far as you can...
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-184.wav|Out of guilt.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-611.wav|You sense a little hesitation there, or maybe even fear? The stress was on the wrong syllable.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-712.wav|She doesn't feel like a Klaasje. She feels like nothing.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-772.wav|Gearing up for this betrayal is hard for her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-936.wav|There is desperation there, in that silence. A cornered animal looking for a way out.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-998.wav|That can wait. Look into her eyes, there's more.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1251.wav|She fears an arrest right here and now. This has been an awful turn of events for her.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3 ORB  age afterthought-31.wav|Here it comes, mercy.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F3 ORB  love did him in-43.wav|Real as anything.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-23.wav|That was disdain in his eyes. Even now he's purposefully ignoring you.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-27.wav|That was disdain in his eyes. Even now he is purposefully ignoring you. Looks like he's not a fan.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-139.wav|Could he be irritated with you? He avoids eye contact altogether. Like you're not even there.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-242.wav|A very silent wave comes from the lieutenant, like the distant echo of a drum-roll. It's approval.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-561.wav|Are you supposed to feel guilty about the hole? His sigh tells you: yes.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-578.wav|Maybe it's he who's obsessed with "this Sylvie person"? Certainly sounds like it.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-629.wav|He's very animated all of a sudden. This is clearly a touchy subject for him.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-666.wav|There's something there and it's not good. That's all you know for now.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-678.wav|Everything is cool between you and this guy. He's a big fan. Make some small talk.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-14.wav|He sounds irritated.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-347.wav|He's done a fine job too. Though he's spoken of the place dismissively before, the hostel is actually very important to him.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-471.wav|It's as if he can't decide whether to be angry or relieved that it was you, again.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-859.wav|He means it. It's not just boasting. It's something he discovered about himself, stepping onto that balcony.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-936.wav|It is! It's wonder-full!
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-952.wav|YES! The bird is connected to this. It's a symbol of hope and she broke it.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-965.wav|And there we have it. Isn't that beautiful? Another situation fixed by Doctor Love.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-979.wav|People just don't know how to accept gifts, especially taxidermy. He likes it. He likes the bird. It solves his broken bird problem.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1209.wav|Take it easy on him. Deep down he really hates being the guy who has to remind you.
wavs/Empathy-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1222.wav|He's not too offended. The experience has changed something in him.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-170.wav|In his eyes? A half-familiar longing.  Flecks of brown and gold.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-171.wav|Ease into it, don't go too far. This seems like a personal matter...
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-173.wav|Behind the laugh, however, a touch of sorrow.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-385.wav|The realization that you've used his friendliness and good will for your own ends.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-390.wav|Push Tommy and it will break his heart, and his spirit. Don't expect you to be pals.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-412.wav|He's seen your kind before. As a lorry driver he's familiar with every addiction, compulsion, and self-destructive habit known to a man.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-433.wav|There it is again, a little touch of sadness beneath his cool. He thinks he's spent too long in this lorry.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-440.wav|Just like that, he slips out of your reach. It is possible the YELLING didn't help.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-593.wav|And he's sorry he couldn't be what he wants to be, a good person. His last line, his revenge on the world.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-667.wav|He's clearly relieved.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-673.wav|He's relieved.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-675.wav|He cannot believe it.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-688.wav|The lieutenant is too tired to be cross with you, he just wants to get back to it.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-701.wav|The lieutenant is too tired to be cross with you, he just wants to go.
wavs/Empathy-JAM  TOMMY-748.wav|He still is, hoping. It's just wishful thinking on his part, not trickery.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-4.wav|He's practically tearing up from spite. Hatred got the best of him a long time ago. This man hates everything.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-291.wav|He's liking this.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-292.wav|As he speaks, he stresses every word. He's liking this.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-342.wav|It was dear to him. He resents forgetting it.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-775.wav|Are they not heartbroken? How could they have moved on?
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-853.wav|He does not want to see life moving on. People forgetting. Drinking. Laughing.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-1031.wav|He is not afraid of such displays. This was the wrong move...
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-97.wav|You've never seen him get this excited. His voice is almost trembling.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-118.wav|Like laughter. A sort of happiness.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-236.wav|In some kind of strange, semi-catatonic state.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-246.wav|It's too late now.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-374.wav|The stimulus overloaded it. It's passing, like an extended moment, or a gall stone.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-748.wav|Cuno can't believe how bad he is, without a camera, in this situation the binoclard would be superior in every way.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-752.wav|Cuno can't believe how lame he is, without the camera right now. Should have stolen one, a real cop would have one...

wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-855.wav|In some kind of strange, semi-catatonic state.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-864.wav|In some kind of strange, semi-catatonic state. He's not looking so good.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-920.wav|In some kind of strange, semi-catatonic state.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT INT  AFTERDOLORES TALK-23.wav|He's still worried. You must have really thrashed and squealed in your sleep.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT INT  AFTERDOLORES TALK-58.wav|It's not good, this C in his dreams.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  KLAASJE PASSPORT-16.wav|Would it? Maybe it was simply curious.
wavs/Empathy-INVENTORY  KLAASJE PASSPORT-155.wav|An old photo. Before life came and did what it does.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-339.wav|He seems tender suddenly, nostalgic even. A strange mood swing.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-237.wav|On her.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-288.wav|A brief flash of terror.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-346.wav|A bitter taste on his tongue.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-563.wav|While he stands here and rots.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-8.wav|Perhaps. But his seems more than that. The inner turmoil takes unexpected turns, as if forced on him in a way...
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-34.wav|Great leaps of emotion: from anger to grief, despair...
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-465.wav|The same old freezing hatred.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-643.wav|He was worried for him.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-647.wav|He seems relieved. Could he have been worried for him?
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-670.wav|It doesn't look like he is. Okay.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-766.wav|He reminded him of himself. The same hatred. The same... You try to think of something else, but no, it's just hatred.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-22.wav|You've startled him... maybe it was the silence? He quickly gathers himself. Still, what could he be afraid of?
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-32.wav|This terror is the sum of all the uncontrollable movements and mood swings he's been exhibiting.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-103.wav|This terror, the sum of all the uncontrollable movements and mood swings he's been exhibiting...
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-317.wav|This terror, the sum of all the uncontrollable movements and mood swings he's been exhibiting...
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-394.wav|With fear and longing.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-451.wav|It's not just chemical.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-458.wav|The man shudders lightly, his eyes swallowed up by their pupils.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-508.wav|You've gotten all you will out of this poor being.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  MATTRESS NEST-102.wav|The lieutenant pauses. Regret comes over him.
wavs/Empathy-SEAFORT  MATTRESS NEST-104.wav|He's conflicted for a second. There's guilt there, it takes him a moment to rationalize it away.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-146.wav|The lieutenant is genuinely worried for his life. You should consult him before getting in there.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-202.wav|He has to. The rifleman will fire at you again.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-291.wav|I think he's calmed down a bit...
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-303.wav|He is. I was wrong.
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-347.wav|No, please. Peace, it has worked this far. Start with the first idea you have, move down from that...
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-361.wav|Peace. Always peace, it has worked thus far. Start with the first idea you have, then move down from that, please...
wavs/Empathy-PLAZA  KORTENAER-377.wav|Peace. Always peace, it has worked thus far. Start with the first idea you have, move down from that, please...
wavs/Empathy-TRIBUNAL  THIRD GUY-36.wav|That struck some chord, a dark chord.
wavs/Empathy-GATES  SCAB LEADER-35.wav|The mention of a killing sends a barely noticeable shiver of tenseness through him. Interesting...
wavs/Empathy-GATES  SCAB LEADER-320.wav|The story must have stirred up some conflicting emotions. The man looks tired for a second...
wavs/Empathy-GATES  SCAB LEADER-337.wav|You see dead flesh, in colourful rivers of Polychrome, melting skin and hair.
wavs/Empathy-GATES  MANANA-68.wav|The man is deeply moved. You see his eyes turn teary with appreciation. He is extremely happy for you.
wavs/Empathy-GATES  MANANA-255.wav|Beneath the jolliness he suddenly seems doubtful.
wavs/Empathy-GATES  MANANA-531.wav|He is sincerely grateful he is not tracking down pieces of armour right now.
wavs/Empathy-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-625.wav|There is a strange sadness in his tone. A less than heroic melancholy this time...
wavs/Empathy-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-646.wav|He does not seem angry, nor does the woman look affected. She just twirls her hair. Perhaps they've been through this and established an accord?
wavs/Volition-THOUGHT  WORLD REPUBLIC-40.wav|There's one.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-2.wav|A mirror hangs above a bent and broken sink. In a fierce discharge of masculine energy someone has ripped half the faucet off.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-3.wav|Hot water sprays from the base and steam covers the mirror. You cannot see yourself, just the outline of a man.
wavs/alternative-0-Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-3-0.wav|Hot water sprays from the faucet's base and steam covers the mirror. You cannot see yourself, just a vague impression of a man. 
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-8.wav|Yeah, there is definitely something wrong with it.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-10.wav|Where to even begin? There's the bloatedness, then the swollenness... It's like there's an upholstery of alcohol underneath your skin.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-13.wav|It's not. It's swollen and snail-like, wriggling between your fingers.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-19.wav|Behold!

wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-35.wav|You are correct.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-36.wav|There might have been. Ten years ago. It's little more than a cadaverous spasm now.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-41.wav|You should check yourself for a pulse, superstar. From here it looks like a cadaverous spasm.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-42.wav|You should check yourself for a pulse, because from here it looks like a cadaverous spasm.

wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-65.wav|Good call. Go ahead and try something, if you like. Or, you know, stop staring into the mirror.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-66.wav|That's right! Not even yourself. Go ahead, try something, it's not an order.
wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-110.wav|It doesn't have to be. You can swoon over Guillaume and his champagne-cork smile whenever you want to... Maybe some of the stardust will return?

wavs/Mirror-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-123.wav|No. That would be too insane.

wavs/Composure-PLAZA  ANNETTE-209.wav|There is stress and unease behind these words. She's reciting etiquette.

wavs/Composure-FRITTE  FRITTE CLERK-193.wav|She blinks at you, confused as to why you'd ask such an obvious thing.
wavs/Composure-VILLAGE  POSSE-878.wav|'You should've done a better job' is what it's saying.

wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  WCH-16.wav|The leather jacket suits him well. It must be custom-made.
wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  WCH-231.wav|Calm now. Carefully. Just another day, just another dead body. Breathe.
wavs/Composure-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-808.wav|The you she saw is gone, too. A small stack of sticks stands in its place. Begging.
wavs/Composure-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-24.wav|This is not a man easily toyed with.
wavs/Composure-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-796.wav|You tilt your head, also looking at the corpse.
wavs/Composure-YARD  HANGED MAN-218.wav|The lieutenant nods often. It's part of his un-plastic expression range, communicating both professionalism and sarcasm. This time, the latter.
wavs/Composure-PAWNSHOP  ROY-259.wav|There was something awfully deliberate about that laziness.
wavs/Composure-PAWNSHOP  SAWED-OFF STREET LIGHT-17.wav|His manner is casual, but his speech is careful, measured. He wants you to know that he has nothing to hide.
wavs/Composure-KIM SWITCH  PAWNSHOP-24.wav|The lieutenant's tone doesn't betray any frustration. Concern, yes.
wavs/Composure-KIM SWITCH  PAWNSHOP-27.wav|He is mildly offended that his display of camaraderie went wrong, though it doesn't show in his posture.
wavs/Composure-CANAL  MAN ON WATER LOCK-103.wav|He doesn't actually seem to be in a rush. It's not in his nature. Enviable calm.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-614.wav|Quickly, methodically, like an electric printing machine.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-910.wav|Positively statuesque.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1087.wav|Fast, observantly. Like an electronic printer.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1395.wav|It truly isn't. She controls herself very well.
wavs/Composure-PIER  CINDY-151.wav|Hatred? Disgust? It's difficult to tell which of the two is more present in her girlish features.
wavs/Composure-PIER  CINDY-228.wav|Her voice sounds different when she speaks this candidly. Older somehow.

wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-399.wav|Her arms fall to her sides, her spine relaxes.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-573.wav|He's able to contain the anger and surprise.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-587.wav|This is going to be hard to recover from.
wavs/Composure-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-858.wav|Not even a flinch. That must take willpower. Yet below it, some little crack starts running in the foundation.

wavs/Composure-JAM  RACIST-633.wav|Be careful. This man's still got some fight in him, by the looks of it. It won't be easy break him.
wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO-405.wav|The pants are totally okay, don't listen to her, she's trying to give you body image problems.

wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO SCENE-75.wav|Despite the early spring chill, the boy is wearing short track pants that leave his legs exposed below the knee. They look dynamic.
wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-152.wav|He usually looks you straight in the eye. A little something just crumbled there.
wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO SHACK-9.wav|He is incredibly pleased with himself right now.
wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO LOCUSTS-109.wav|As you leave, you notice his usual rooster-like swaying posture has changed, slowed down. Like clockwork unwinding.
wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO SPEED-262.wav|His posture changes, the swaying rooster motion stops for a second. Then he gets it going again. Reorienting himself.
wavs/Composure-YARD  CUNO SPEED-303.wav|Only his tightly closed lips betray the effort keeping silent takes him.

wavs/Composure-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-420.wav|You've managed to catch the lieutenant off guard, but only for a moment. He quickly recomposes himself.
wavs/Composure-APT  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-80.wav|Something tells you you're never going to talk to an individual this cool or mysterious ever again.
wavs/Composure-APT  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-113.wav|He's barely holding it together. It's all he can do to keep from bursting out in laughter.
wavs/Composure-APT  REAL ESTATE AGENT-31.wav|A sudden serious look crosses her face. This story didn't have a happy ending.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-316.wav|The gesture resembles an orchestra conductor bringing the choir to a full stop.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-817.wav|He's not the least bit curious about what you planned to say.
wavs/Composure-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-442.wav|Yet were he to quit, he would lose the cool factor. This man relishes his cool quite a bit, below it all.
wavs/Composure-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-453.wav|He has internalized it well. It's just that. A fact. A self-contained, past event.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-34.wav|Even though she has excellent control over her self, something moved behind her eyes, in the way she stands, in her face...
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-39.wav|He and his men carry themselves like giants. You'll need to prove your mettle to be taken seriously.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-364.wav|Wants the world to know he's a macho-macho man: tobacco-chewing and knuckle-cracking. Who else do we have here?
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-81.wav|Titus is solid as a rock, and so are a few others, but...
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-82.wav|Actually, they're admirably, surprisingly, composed. The entire room. Given how many questions you've lobbed their way.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-412.wav|This one is a stone wall. You won't get more out of them about the night of the murder, not yet.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-543.wav|Keep your eye on this 'powerful guy'. Sooner or later he's going to break like a piece of twig.

wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-4.wav|He tenses immediately. Chest tightens. Jaw sets. Ready for another blow.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-285.wav|Fat Angus. The powerful guy. Mr. All Muscle. The time has come, put him in the pressure cooker.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-153.wav|He's not alarmed by the sudden appearance of a witness. But he is surprised.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-456.wav|He tries to make it sound real casual, but the muscles on his neck tighten.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-384.wav|He looks tough but there is a nervous twitch in his dark green eye. This is all too close to home for him.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-440.wav|His tone is totally different now. The jolly man of the people is gone and so is the smile.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-610.wav|With a mixture of expectation and impatience, well bottled.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-612.wav|He looks extremely comfortable. The tiny folding chair, on the other hand, looks like a torture device.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-613.wav|The folding chair looks like a torture device. Extremely uncomfortable.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-274.wav|He didn't actually understand what you meant and now he's just nodding along.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-187.wav|There's something different about him now. He's more vibrant. More alive in his 'Big-Time mode'.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-218.wav|Nothing in his features betrays any concern.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-260.wav|He proudly spreads his hands to demonstrate the size of the palaces. They're very large.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-489.wav|He performs a motion, as if spraying bullets from a machine gun.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-224.wav|The lieutenant has granted you an aura of legitimacy. Bathe in it, but don't let your satisfaction show. Play it cool.
wavs/Composure-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-145.wav|His expression makes it clear: this is childish and irresponsible behaviour.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA ORB  rain shivers-11.wav|You're not dressed for this weather. You should get an overcoat, or a patrol cloak.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA ORB  col do ma ma daqua afterthought-18.wav|Keep still! It might perch on your shoulder.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-194.wav|She hides it well, but behind the sweat and dirt there is something... else. In her rigid posture.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-198.wav|The quickness of the reply certainly does not prove you wrong.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-422.wav|She's a pro. Nothing short of coming face to face with the fatman himself would make her admit it right now.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-427.wav|She's very well composed. Back straight.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-30.wav|The lieutenant's voice is as calm as usual, a testament to the violence and death he's witnessed through the sight of his firearm.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-276.wav|Your lack of imagination is baffling. But you do make up for it with... yes. Questions.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA ORB  wearing skullboy jackets-2.wav|You've finally made it haven't you? People point fingers at you and whisper to each other when you pass by, wondering to themselves:
wavs/Composure-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-871.wav|Whatever happened, keep your cool. It's probably better to admit that it was a harmless prank.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-61.wav|She's obviously a bit uncomfortable in your company.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-66.wav|Something about the man with sunglasses and you, the energy between you two, is making her uncomfortable.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-133.wav|She's trying to keep a straight face.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-83.wav|It's the sports, he's a sports guy, all about that physical prowess and athletic skill... Nothing else here.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  MORELL-32.wav|His self-conscious enthusiasm renders his movements ungainly. He looks like your understanding of a scientist.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  MORELL-429.wav|He has a 38 degree fever. His resilience has given way.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  MORELL-438.wav|The slouch in his shoulders tells you otherwise. He doesn't know how many more field expeditions he has left in him...
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  MORELL-587.wav|He keeps the language unemotional but it's in there, disappointment.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-128.wav|He's trying too hard to seem untroubled by your question. The rigidity in his posture gives him away.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-175.wav|His eyes widened at the sight of the mug. He's seen it before alright.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-268.wav|As he lowers his tone he hunches his back.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-270.wav|Okay, he keeps shifting uncomfortably, but you can't make head or tail of this sound, and honestly it's rude to stare, so stop.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-521.wav|No, he's scrawny. Try again.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-612.wav|He's not feeling very comfy in his clothes, is he? Strange...
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-615.wav|He's not feeling too comfortable in his own skin. Odd, I'd say.
wavs/Composure-WESTCOAST  GARY-643.wav|There's something going on here. You should observe him more closely, after this topic is concluded.
wavs/Composure-COAST ORB  reeds by camp site-101.wav|They're not really going to get the chance to get comfortable here.
wavs/Composure-INVENTORY  DELUXE TOPPING PIE-48.wav|His tone is almost stern beneath the politeness.
wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-154.wav|His shoulders relax and a look of realization appears in his eyes... Did he notice something?
wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-225.wav|In this moment of hesitation she almost doesn't seem disturbed, but like someone suddenly waking from a deep sleep.
wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-272.wav|The situation looks bad. Calm yourself. Steady your breathing.
wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-152.wav|He assumes something like a combat stance, facing the wind.
wavs/Composure-INVENTORY  FILTHY JACKET-3.wav|Some secrets are better left uncovered. Don't even try, seriously.
wavs/Composure-INVENTORY  FILTHY JACKET-14.wav|Why, why did you think about it? Look at your hands, They're covered in muck!
wavs/Composure-INVENTORY  FILTHY JACKET-29.wav|Now you're just flicking that shit everywhere! This is a disaster. You'll never get the smell out.
wavs/Composure-INVENTORY  FILTHY JACKET-34.wav|It's too late! You've already thought about it. And now your hands are covered in muck!
wavs/Composure-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-68.wav|No. Wait... Earlier the lieutenant noticed something. Something about the gun... Could it be empty without her knowing it?
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-50.wav|She tries to look indifferent, but still has to take a drag of her cigarette, so as not to flinch.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-451.wav|If any of this made her nervous, it certainly doesn't show in her expression or her movements.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-1038.wav|What could she be thinking of? It's hard to say, her shoulders are relaxed, her eyes on the cigarette.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-1064.wav|She's straight as a stick, suddenly.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-195.wav|He takes a small step closer.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-509.wav|Me? No way, I'm straight, man.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-514.wav|Yes, he's talking about you, you shifty asshole.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-436.wav|Her voice is like a slash through the air. Her shoulders tense up.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-702.wav|She understands what autopsies entail. It doesn't get her off-balance.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-24.wav|Just like that. No resistance, her shoulders are slouched, her feet long and straight.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-490.wav|Her jaw is clenched. Her throat moves. It takes all her strength not to cave in and sob... once... just one time...
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1024.wav|Her chest rises and falls with each word. She keeps herself together, and says it...
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F3 ORB  love did him in-32.wav|There's a nod, the smallest of nods.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-575.wav|He's very animated all of a sudden. This seems like a touchy subject.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-198.wav|He's attempting to maintain an air of indifference. It's absolutely not convincing.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-325.wav|He trembled just a little as he assumed this position. You've made him nervous, though he doesn't want to show it.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-395.wav|The colour has drained from his face.
wavs/Composure-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1113.wav|He's really, really holding himself back here.
wavs/Composure-JAM  TOMMY-33.wav|He tries his best to look nonchalant, but there's a rigidity in him, as if trying to conceal something warm and deep beneath a cool exterior.
wavs/Composure-JAM  TOMMY-89.wav|A flinch jolts his frame. The question has touched a nerve.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-109.wav|His right eye twitches, with what? Fear? Rage?
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-204.wav|His nostrils are still flaring with rage. He brings himself back under his own stewardship, slowly.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-341.wav|He waves erratically, with his hand, annoyed that he can't remember. A little tremor passes through him.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-712.wav|The expression on his face is unreadable. There's some sort of interference there... neurological?
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-898.wav|Something is very wrong with him now.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-925.wav|Like an untrained fighter he leans forward, back hunched, ready to spring.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-85.wav|Something in its body language has changed, just slightly...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-291.wav|Like a little boy... for a moment he's unable to keep it together when he looks at the slip.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-67.wav|You went in too fast. Over-eager.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-331.wav|There is a small tremble, looks like a smile. A crooked smile. Yet isn't quite voluntary. He's about to burst...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-383.wav|In his fit of rage he seems to have broken loose from something. A little fire gutters deep in his eyes, like a pilot light in the hallway...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-701.wav|...while the lieutenant listens, holding his breath.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-81.wav|There it is again. The strange neurological state he's sometimes in.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-85.wav|A strange confusion comes over him from time to time. Some kind of aberration of the nervous system?
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-274.wav|And inexplicably. It doesn't go with his pained voice.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-10.wav|For a sixty-year-old man with stomach trouble, who's spent his entire life alone on an uninhabited island, he seems surprisingly fit.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-15.wav|He's clearly a drug user of the painkillers sort, prone to erratic hand gestures, and malnourished. But that's it. The moment passes and you say...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-19.wav|Aside from the rare erratic hand gesture, smacking his lips and despondently staring into the fire, you can only see that he is old.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-32.wav|You've seen demented people before. This feels similar, yet different. When his thoughts move they are lucid, keen even, not senile.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-40.wav|In summary, you sense some underlying neurological disorder.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-51.wav|It's not a downer. Rather an upper, judging by his snaps.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-66.wav|There it is again, erratic hand motions. Bouts of rage. And the stomach thing too of course...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-105.wav|A strange little engine seems to fire up in him again. It straightens his back.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-33.wav|The sum of all the erratic movements, fidgeting and mood swings he's been exhibiting...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-105.wav|The sum of all the erratic, involuntary movements and mood swings he's been exhibiting...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-177.wav|He's regressing, fast.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-318.wav|The sum of all the erratic movements, fidgeting and mood swings he's been exhibiting...
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-489.wav|Quite a few things about that health check you did on him make sense now.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-518.wav|This is an old man, at last. No longer a tin soldier, but the broken down remains of a man.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT ORB  full faln set-4.wav|Go on! The fucking sunset awaits, FALN rider!
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT ORB  full faln set-7.wav|You are Next Century personified, the synthetic man!
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT ORB  full faln set-9.wav|You are literally untouchable. A god among mere men.
wavs/Composure-SEAFORT  MATTRESS NEST-213.wav|Then again... his face twitches.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  KORTENAER-345.wav|Yes, yes! Just throw the bomb at him. I'm barely keep you together here, no time to talk. He will only rattle you.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  KORTENAER-365.wav|Yes, yes! Just shoot him. I'm barely keeping you together here, no time to talk. He will only rattle you.
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  KORTENAER-374.wav|I'm barely keeping you together here. The more you talk the harder it will get, I'm afraid...
wavs/Composure-PLAZA  KORTENAER-417.wav|Normal police officer clothes just don't go well with a multi-patterned disco tie made of 98.7% pure flammable polyester.
wavs/Composure-TRIBUNAL  THEY DID NOT DO THIS!-9.wav|He is tense, like a steel spring under full load.
wavs/Composure-TRIBUNAL  YOU ARE DRUNK!-23.wav|He must be tweaked off too. With something other than alcohol. They always are...
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-22.wav|Boots, black in colour, crafted of hardened leather, if you had to guess. They look sturdy and stable, useful in rugged environments.
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-102.wav|I stand corrected.
wavs/alternative-0-Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-102-0.wav|Fuckin' a, that's a solid slice of self-respect.
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-107.wav|Geez, live a little. At least give things a try. It's just boots. A set of sweet, stylish boots.
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-109.wav|Ask the man. Ask around. The doors of good taste are open to you. Be in vogue.
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-156.wav|Fine. It was probably nothing.
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-224.wav|Yes, he's tense.
wavs/Composure-GATES  SCAB LEADER-336.wav|Hard as a stone. But beneath it...

wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-701.wav|Wait! She just admitted that the lynching and the strike are connected.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-844.wav|Don't let her answer it herself.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1471.wav|This checks out.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1487.wav|... they're profiting from this trade.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1503.wav|This one's a slippery eel.

wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  CINDY-415.wav|This is the Cindy that misters 'Piss' and 'Fuck' said had the armoured gloves. Play it cool now...
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  CINDY-417.wav|Something about skulls, gloves... what was it? Maybe it'll come to you later.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  CINDY-451.wav|She immediately regrets telling you, but it's too late.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-1003.wav|You should ask the Paledriver about this. See what she says.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-60.wav|No, it's not that, it's... I have no idea. This is bad.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-764.wav|A flash of satisfaction. She can use this, in the future. To turn the tide against Evrart on the streets.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-37.wav|Isn't that written on your...
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-306.wav|He's really been keeping tabs, on you, the Hardies, even the company rep.
wavs/Reaction Speed-PLAZA  GRAFFITO-93.wav|This was Cindy the SKULL.

wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  INSTIGATOR CABIN-296.wav|This is the one he pointed to. The green lorry...
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-376.wav|Realizing he can't get out of it. Smart man.
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-462.wav|Interesting. Could this driver be connected to the Hardie boys?
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-470.wav|There you go. A witness with corroborating evidence: it's Ruby.
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  box of sun glasses-30.wav|Hey, at least it might actually offer some protection against the sun, not like those cheap plastic shades.
wavs/Reaction Speed-KIM SWITCH  LORRY CONCLUSIONS-47.wav|In short: this is a future angle. Possibly a good one.
wavs/Reaction Speed-KIM SWITCH  LORRY CONCLUSIONS-48.wav|Meaning: someone as slippery as Evrart won't be caught by a couple of cops and some stuff they found in some cabin.
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  PALEDRIVER-438.wav|All of what, the world? The present?
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  RACIST-435.wav|There was a bunch of spilled boxes in the back of a big lorry nearby...
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  RACIST-441.wav|This man looks like trouble. You might not want to get into this right now.
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  RACIST-570.wav|Or you could look around, find this guy's cabin. Check all the lorries. It's scary when cops are snooping in your things, no?
wavs/Reaction Speed-JAM  RACIST-614.wav|Not sheep, ostriches.

wavs/Reaction Speed-YARD  CUNO-377.wav|Except kipts.
wavs/Reaction Speed-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-151.wav|Everyone can hear. You need to get the hell out of here before...
wavs/Reaction Speed-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-289.wav|Interesting. This tug of war has probably happened between her and Cuno's violent father too.
wavs/Reaction Speed-YARD  CUNO BODY-120.wav|He could've just said he doesn't know.

wavs/Reaction Speed-YARD  CUNO LOCUSTS-32.wav|There's definitely something going on here. You should check out Cuno's shack, the one with the pig's head.
wavs/Reaction Speed-YARD  CUNO LOCUSTS-124.wav|There's definitely something going on here. Maybe he's got them stashed somewhere nearby, in some hidden place?

wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-448.wav|There's a joke here, and you know what it is.
wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-456.wav|That's why it's good.
wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-738.wav|That was a wink. Your good cop/idiot cop routine seems to have done the trick.
wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-742.wav|If he knows so much about Oranje, maybe he also knows about Oranjese mercenaries?
wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-818.wav|Two Areopagites and a Mesque, could be Eugene, Theo, and Alain.
wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  SMOKER DOOR-5.wav|Number twenty eight... This is where the cleaning lady said the smoker on the balcony lives.
wavs/Reaction Speed-APT  SMOKER DOOR-87.wav|Damn. Turns out it's quite tricky finding someone in a big apartment building... Don't worry. You'll get him!
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-128.wav|So he volunteered to represent the 57th, but not out of competitiveness, on the contrary.
wavs/Reaction Speed-KIM SWITCH  DAY TWO UNION-68.wav|Yeah, streetwise. Zoom right past, do it on your own terms.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-130.wav|Just keep talking. Put something on the table. Something incriminating.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-180.wav|There's a catch hidden somewhere. He didn't confess so that you could take them all away. It's too simple.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-359.wav|The lieutenant goes in for the leg sweep, Titus does not see it coming.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-376.wav|No, he hasn't. Not yet.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-387.wav|That definitely caught him off guard. In comes No. 2 to take care of it.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-439.wav|Guns are stocked between the belts, three, maybe four firearms. Although Fat Angus might be just pulling up his pants, not sure...
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-182.wav|The man is slowing down. Looks like a bad blood sugar crash. He can't keep track of all the variables anymore.

wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-52.wav|She cut in so Titus wouldn't have to answer.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-211.wav|The thought forms in your head, like a lightning strike branching in the sky.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-239.wav|Despite everything, the little man is quick on his feet.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-273.wav|Little shit? That's Cuno in the yard.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-276.wav|This was good. Every little piece helps put the big puzzle together.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-617.wav|You just showed him a breech-loading gun!
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-671.wav|But what if you miss interesting information that way? The choice is ultimately yours, but...

wavs/Reaction Speed-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART GUN-42.wav|It did not come as a surprise to him. He might actually not be bullshitting.
wavs/Reaction Speed-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-49.wav|But will there be giant statues of the Claire brothers towering above it all? Joyce knew he was up to something.
wavs/Reaction Speed-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-181.wav|A guy, huh?

wavs/Reaction Speed-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-91.wav|And just like that, it's happening, the roller coaster is moving. Too late to take it back now.
wavs/Reaction Speed-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-244.wav|This woman may be running drugs for him. There's no way he doesn't know her.

wavs/Reaction Speed-DOOMED  ICE BEAR FRIDGE-140.wav|This must be the giant ice bear fridge that Soona mentioned. Look inside.

wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1056.wav|Of course. Keep your eyes open for the killer instead.
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1204.wav|She knows something!
wavs/Reaction Speed-WHIRLING F3 ORB  age afterthought-104.wav|You could ask either one of them.

wavs/Interfacing-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-37.wav|The smell of freshly treated leather, the lack of dirt and dust on the dashboard, and a neat little brush in the cup-holder all seem to be whispering:
wavs/Interfacing-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-41.wav|At the bottom of the sea...
wavs/Interfacing-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-44.wav|You feel an uninterrupted connection to the mechanics.
wavs/Interfacing-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-53.wav|Of course it's only in your head, of course it is, but it almost feels as if the clutch handle is gently squeezing back.
wavs/Interfacing-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-56.wav|The handle is pulled back. Somewhere deep inside the drivetrain the disk is mated to the flywheel again.

wavs/Interfacing-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-273.wav|What were you trying to achieve by closing your eyes? Did you want your muscle memory to take over and call somewhere? Where?
wavs/Interfacing-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-274.wav|41, 44, 47,  it's too late now, the movement is almost mechanical.

wavs/Interfacing-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-291.wav|Again you close your eyes, and again your fingers move on the rotary dial. Ten metallic rings as the dial returns to zero after each number.
wavs/Interfacing-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-293.wav|You dialled 001. This is not the area code of Revachol. It is another destination, on another isola. Some far-off nation state.

wavs/Logic-PLAZA ORB  mullen mistaken identity conclusion-22.wav|Maybe if there had been more money... and less speed...
wavs/Logic-PLAZA ORB  mullen mistaken identity conclusion-29.wav|Sure, why not? Everyone knows politicians are corrupt, and what's more corrupt than letting your entitled spawn run around offing people?
wavs/Logic-PLAZA ORB  mullen mistaken identity conclusion-32.wav|Sure, yes. They died of an over-abundance of love. Just loved each other to death. Couldn't get enough love. And now they're dead.

wavs/Logic-PLAZA  GASTON CHEATING-78.wav|All that blunt data must have triggered an information hoarding reflex of sorts. Think of it like a small seizure. It will pass.

wavs/Logic-PLAZA  GASTON CASE-53.wav|He doesn't know anything, because no one tells him anything. He's an outsider.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  GASTON CASE-59.wav|That's why Gaston isn't a Union member. Evrart needs a 'neutral' party to speak his ideas.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  RIVER CRATER-19.wav|It was probably a bit more complicated than that.

wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  BATHROOM MIRROR-50.wav|Probably not, no.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  ELEVATOR-37.wav|This elevator must have been used to transport pinball machines to and from the upstairs workshop.

wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3 ORB  pinball workshop-7.wav|This seems to be some kind of workshop. For fixing up pinball machines, a long time ago. Everything is covered with dust now...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3 ORB  pinball workshop-33.wav|Yes. Pinball hasn't enjoyed a heyday for fifteen or twenty years.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3 ORB  pinball workshop-40.wav|Yes. Martinaise North 22 used to be a pinball arcade.

wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3 ORB  pinball workshop-49.wav|Yes. It would mean that.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3 ORB  pinball workshop-50.wav|And Garte would not like that. He should probably be made aware that his establishment is part of the neighbourhood ghost story.

wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-68.wav|A cool leather jacket with a bolt of blue? Oh no, this sounds terribly familiar...
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-119.wav|This is what killed him.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-201.wav|A bad fall. It might have been dark outside? This place is a mine field in the dark.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-225.wav|Agreed. If this somehow converges later, why not. But keep it simple for now.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-226.wav|Sometimes a kebab is just a kebab.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-234.wav|To hide the stench of alcohol no doubt.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  WCH-241.wav|That's what the chewing gum seems to point to as well.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LIBRARY CARD-26.wav|You already decided to let the station handle the case, so there's no need to call the library.

wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-175.wav|It'd be nifty if you found something that way, wouldn't it? The papers still sagging from the clipboard in your hand, not so nifty.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-180.wav|Once all the tasks are accomplished, the case is complete.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-218.wav|It's the middle of March, you have attempted two cases a week on average.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-241.wav|A lot? A little? You have no idea, this all depends.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-354.wav|I got nothing here either. Logic really isn't the best faculty to have this conversation with, But it's the one you got, so sorry.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-356.wav|That... is improbable.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-366.wav|It takes about half an hour to piece one together, using the system you've devised. Which one do you want?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-367.wav|It takes about half an hour to piece one together, using the system you've devised. Where do you want to start?
wavs/alternative-0-Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-370-0.wav|It's proving to be harder than expected. You just don't have the intellectual rigour to patch the quilt back together, try again later?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-371.wav|Forty one is your precinct.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-374.wav|No, the alphanumeric begins with HDB.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-378.wav|Why yes. Your precinct number is 41.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-384.wav|That's comforting to hear. Now, detective. It takes half an hour to piece one of these together, if you still want to. Here are your options.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-438.wav|Permeables. It's not hidden per se, the compartment is made for permeable materials that would get damaged if something happened to it.

wavs/Logic-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-466.wav|The damage is too extensive.
wavs/Logic-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-469.wav|This was 20% of the station's vehicular budget?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  BADGE-157.wav|The numbers are not there for 'good measure'. They have an administrative purpose. One that's unfortunately been erased from your memory.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  BADGE-174.wav|But the badge is new. You used an old photo for a new badge.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  BADGE-181.wav|A new document is given to you as part of a promotion. Or when you lose the old one.
wavs/Logic-PAWNSHOP  ROY-461.wav|Sea birds, most likely. Gulls and such.
wavs/Logic-PAWNSHOP  ROY-526.wav|Looking at his wares, talking to him, that might give you more clues.
wavs/Logic-PAWNSHOP  ROY-567.wav|A needle in a haystack. There is nothing you can do it about it now. You'll just have to hope you luck upon her somehow.
wavs/Logic-PAWNSHOP  RACK OF SECOND-HAND UNIFORMS-22.wav|That's very cheap for a printed t-shirt that's still in pretty good shape.
wavs/Logic-CANAL  MAN ON WATER LOCK-114.wav|You should probably tell Lena. It'll take a load off her mind.
wavs/Logic-CANAL  HAWTHORN-96.wav|Maybe Roy from the pawnshop can help you with this?
wavs/Logic-CANAL  WATERLOCK LEVER-49.wav|You should probably tell Lena. It'll take a load off her mind.
wavs/Logic-CANAL  WATERLOCK LEVER-54.wav|Could this be why Morell hasn't returned to Lena?
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-104.wav|She's referring to Lieutenant Kitsuragi's motor carriage.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-430.wav|You'd be shooting yourself in the foot, in other words.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-457.wav|Most of the workers probably don't know what that means.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-615.wav|She's memorizing your badge number.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-641.wav|She must have been suspecting something for a while now.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-691.wav|She wants you to help her gain leverage to re-start negotiations with the Union.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-721.wav|The hand-off. The motor lorries at the roundabout.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1090.wav|She is memorizing your badge number.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1488.wav|Uncovering Union secrets could also give you an upper hand when dealing with them.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1516.wav|Let's be honest, you have no idea what that meant, interisolary microwave compression? Moving on...
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1531.wav|Remember those bold, new exotic revenue streams Evrart said he was going to fund his harbour with? You should go back and ask him about that.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1535.wav|Remember those bold, new exotic revenue streams Evrart said he was going to fund his harbour with? You should go back and ask him about that.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-84.wav|The Union has over two thousand men.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-213.wav|The lieutenant was testing her, asking a small detail first to see if she knew him better than she let on. She passed.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-383.wav|The other has a vantage point in a building South of the roundabout, they were keeping tabs on you while you were canvassing the lorry drivers.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-457.wav|You wouldn't even know where to start.
wavs/Logic-PIER  CINDY-391.wav|There weren't any other small girls in the village.
wavs/Logic-KIM SWITCH  JOYCE DRUGS-20.wav|The situation might have changed drastically by the time you locate it. Time is of the essence...
wavs/Logic-KIM SWITCH  JOYCE DRUGS-31.wav|Maybe this is all her plan? She might have heard about you.
wavs/Logic-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-105.wav|For her to be where she is Wild Pines Group must have picked the right side.

wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-27.wav|The lieutenant might have, but I don't remember you logging anything as anything, Harry.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-73.wav|How do we get out of here?
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-151.wav|Her bartering mind cannot fathom that you didn't ask anything in return.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-209.wav|Her mind races to the conclusion that most benefits her interests. That doesn't mean she's wrong, though.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-334.wav|Does it matter? Or has her mind been made up for quite a while now?
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-372.wav|All that's left is the denouement.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-389.wav|And what about the next time?
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-487.wav|Events are already in motion. Whether your actions accelerated or momentarily retarded their progress, even the lieutenant cannot really say.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-774.wav|That is very, very likely yes.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-895.wav|That's wrong! You don't get into loops!
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-907.wav|She must really want you to look into the drugs, otherwise she'd tell you.
wavs/Logic-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-925.wav|You wonder what Evrart has to say about this...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-481.wav|That does make (some) sense.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-498.wav|The lieutenant did mention doing more ballistics...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-56.wav|The bullet must have passed through your shoulder blade, missing your lung and your heart. You lucky son of a bitch...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-79.wav|He didn't.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-146.wav|Doesn't sound like she's planning to come back.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-249.wav|He is streetwise. Knows the neighbourhood. Knows the people. He could be useful.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-286.wav|There were only ten people present at the fight. Ten times more than that is very unlikely.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-287.wav|If he did triage and left, you must be relatively stable.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-329.wav|You did mention doing more ballistics...
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  GRAFFITO-56.wav|It's time to crack this case. The next logical move is to go back upstairs, to Klaasje's room. Really inspect that window.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-234.wav|Maybe he has a point there?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-244.wav|He's right. The numbers are replaceable. In an organization of thousands of men, there are plenty who'd join.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  EUGENE AND ALAIN-139.wav|He's not a drinker. Another good thing about him.
wavs/Logic-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-140.wav|He was probably collecting tare or stealing stuff that wasn't nailed down.
wavs/Logic-JAM  INSTIGATOR CABIN-38.wav|Looks like the window might be shatterproof. You may have to rethink your approach.
wavs/Logic-JAM  INSTIGATOR CABIN-165.wav|Sandpaper adds extra grip.
wavs/Logic-JAM  INSTIGATOR CABIN-267.wav|For contacting an entire fleet of lorries, for example. This must be the nerve centre of a well-organized operation.
wavs/Logic-JAM  INSTIGATOR CABIN-271.wav|Looks like the smugglers have infiltrated the road network belonging to East Motor Tract.
wavs/Logic-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-52.wav|But did he first mark them up 100%, just so he could put them on "sale"?
wavs/Logic-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-196.wav|Yes. It's a business secret. Let him keep it.
wavs/Logic-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-474.wav|No, it's still Ruby. Interesting that he doesn't seem aware of her existence, though...
wavs/Logic-JAM  faln sneakers on a pedestal of speakers-84.wav|Of course, yes. Better not risk it.
wavs/Logic-JAM ORB  logic orb-2.wav|Someone here is stealing from a company called Humanox.
wavs/Logic-JAM ORB  logic orb-41.wav|That's what a cop does, isn't it? Keep your eyes peeled... crime is close by.
wavs/Logic-JAM ORB  logic orb-43.wav|Uh, dunno. Nothing, I guess. It's not like there's something you can do, you're but a mere cop.
wavs/Logic-JAM ORB  logic orb-46.wav|Atta boy!
wavs/Logic-KIM SWITCH  LORRY CONCLUSIONS-57.wav|This means it's well funded. Technology like that... a major player must be financing it.
wavs/Logic-JAM  PALEDRIVER-185.wav|She doesn't actually think you're that smart.
wavs/Logic-JAM  PALEDRIVER-407.wav|So he doesn't think she's the lady driver?
wavs/Logic-JAM  PALEDRIVER-443.wav|So he doesn't think she's the smuggler?
wavs/Logic-JAM  RACIST-296.wav|If they were getting drunk inside the Whirling-in-Rags how could they know who broke into the lorry?
wavs/Logic-JAM  RACIST-626.wav|He doesn't live in Martinaise.
wavs/Logic-JAM  RACIST-641.wav|No, it's Ruby running this ring like Titus alluded to. But play along for now. Find out what everyone knows first. Siileng is your next lead.
wavs/Logic-JAM  RACIST-646.wav|No, it's Ruby running this ring like Titus alluded to. But play along for now. Find out what everyone knows first. Siileng is your next lead.
wavs/Logic-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-389.wav|Sound logic, division of labour. She leaves the scepticism to the sceptic.
wavs/Logic-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-726.wav|Indeed. You're always confused as to your whereabouts.
wavs/Logic-VILLAGE  BOAT-45.wav|Remember what the Net Picker said: It's a small tank. You won't be going back and forth on this.
wavs/Logic-VILLAGE  BOAT-66.wav|He hasn't been here before either.
wavs/Logic-VILLAGE  LILIENNES TWINS-171.wav|You will never get an answer. That's how it is with these little idiots.
wavs/Logic-VILLAGE  LILIENNES TWINS-172.wav|Bullet shells? There are a lot of them left over from the war, but this could be important.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNOESSE-76.wav|Logic error! She's not sleeping right now.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-219.wav|Scare him? How did this happen? You can still get out of this, appeal to his reason!
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-341.wav|Relax, he can't read your mind. He doesn't know you were thinking that.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO BODY-95.wav|Has Cuno been to some kind of school? Probably a school for children with behavioural difficulties.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO BODY-109.wav|How is that better? At least get back to the corpse then.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO BODY-133.wav|Thanks, Cuno. That's one name you can now cross off the list.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO FRIDGE-104.wav|Maybe you should ask these things from other, more well mannered kids the next time. Hmm...
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO FRIDGE-105.wav|Hmm... That's actually not such a bad idea. Kids do see stuff.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO SCENE-123.wav|Yes, it seems suspicious. You don't like things being like that... suspicious.
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO SCENE-140.wav|Was there something here you were supposed to pick up on? As soon as it crosses your mind, the thought is gone...
wavs/Logic-YARD  CUNO SCENE-179.wav|...tell the Cuno who it was? He's curious. He likes putting 2 and 2 together here.
wavs/Logic-APT  WCW MAIN-17.wav|She must know you're here because of her husband.
wavs/Logic-APT  WCW MAIN-327.wav|It is.
wavs/Logic-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-371.wav|That doesn't quite comport with what you know. Don't forget the lady driver!
wavs/Logic-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-432.wav|God, yes. Sweet standardisation. The backbone of rationality, and commerce.
wavs/Logic-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-481.wav|That comports with the dicemaker's testimony as well.
wavs/Logic-APT  CUNO DAD-129.wav|The sight you're beholding right now is probably the reason he doesn't.
wavs/Logic-APT  SMOKER DOOR-80.wav|Looks like he isn't home. You should come back later, after 21.00.
wavs/Logic-APT  SMOKER DOOR-81.wav|Looks like he isn't home. You should come back tomorrow evening, after 21.00.
wavs/Logic-APT  SMOKER DOOR-82.wav|Looks like he isn't home. You should come back tomorrow evening, after 21.00.
wavs/Logic-APT  SMOKER DOOR-83.wav|Looks like he isn't home. You should come back later, after 21.00.
wavs/Logic-APT  SMOKER DOOR-84.wav|The man you're looking for is standing right next to you. You should talk to him.
wavs/Logic-APT  CLEANING LADY-147.wav|She's the cleaning lady. She knows the floor plan and the residents.
wavs/Logic-APT  CLEANING LADY-157.wav|They probably just moved, or died, hopefully somewhere else.
wavs/Logic-APT  REAL ESTATE AGENT-53.wav|The sum must've been puny.
wavs/Logic-APT ORB  foreclosed apt logic-2.wav|What happened here?
wavs/Logic-APT ORB  foreclosed apt logic-5.wav|It will still be accessible through the apartment next to it. That one didn't have a door... Sadly, nothing of great value remains here.
wavs/Logic-APT ORB  foreclosed apt logic-9.wav|Put your emotions aside. Try to focus on abstract, impersonal things.
wavs/Logic-APT ORB  foreclosed apt logic-11.wav|Indeed!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM INTRO-100.wav|And then, soon after, dead bodies would be dangling from all the trees.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM INTRO-194.wav|If you're about to embark on an investigation, shouldn't you have a badge?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-79.wav|Clearly he prefers to think you're malingering. He cannot fathom that anyone could drink so much as to retroactively erase their entire life.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-180.wav|Clearly, he has already formed his own theory.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-201.wav|Because you're the best qualified? No, that doesn't seem right...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-559.wav|If you're so well qualified, why can't you remember why you were sent? Anyway, don't keep the lieutenant waiting.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-563.wav|You pick over what's left of your frontal cortex, but no compelling explanations emerge...
wavs/Logic-KIM SWITCH  DEBRIEF DAY ONE-471.wav|Something almost self-explanatory.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-256.wav|This is their last play, this tape. Their story is in tatters, a mess. It might be nice to listen to, but at this point, you don't need to.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-367.wav|He understood what you were doing. Taking inventory of them.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-3.wav|Someone hid the key in the bush and attached a yellow ribbon to make it easier to find.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-83.wav|He's just trying to sound clever. He has no idea what you're looking for, nor do you, yourself.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  SPARE WORKSHOP KEYS-99.wav|It's worth a try.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-93.wav|We've hit a wall. Giving the body a more thorough look might give us some leverage. Just saying.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-341.wav|This is where an autopsy would come in handy, you have to work with what you know.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-348.wav|The autopsy did not reveal anything too conflicting this far. You just have to wing it.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-38.wav|He understood what you were trying to do. Taking inventory of them.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-129.wav|It has to be good if he won't let you pursue it. Looks like the lieutenant thinks so too...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-131.wav|It has to be good if he won't let you pursue it.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-125.wav|Success. They admitted to unlawful collaboration to derail the investigation.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-517.wav|These theories, not bad. Don't buy either one, but still. This guy's not as dumb as he looks.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA ORB  hardie volition afterthought-33.wav|Don't listen to this guy. The theory was solid. He's just jealous. Move on, it's no use harassing her further.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-157.wav|This goes without saying, but nonetheless, don't give out his name.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-98.wav|The window Klaasje gave for the time of death was From 11:30 to 12:15.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-135.wav|This complex operation is probably something illegal.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-152.wav|This one's going into some kind of insane death spiral to preserve his version of the world.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-160.wav|All right. We're in, we got Ruby unaccounted for some time during the window. This was crucial. Now let's place her on that roof.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-295.wav|Phase III: Motive. The last component.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-315.wav|Time for a logics demonstration.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-435.wav|This man is smarter than he looks. We can work with this.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-436.wav|That's a solid logic structure. Do something. This is bad.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-523.wav|Still. The key here is a strange coincidence, and he knows it.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-541.wav|Boy, you really haven't given me a lot to work with here. You should explore better, for now, just wing it.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-594.wav|That wasn't strong.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-635.wav|Phase II: Murder weapon. Get a gun in her hand. If not that, then at least a shadow of a doubt (in the shape of a gun).
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-661.wav|He's angry because he knows you're right. What he's saying only confirms your theory.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-663.wav|That's all you needed. Doubt.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-704.wav|It's that simple.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-726.wav|Here you go: access to the roof, weapon, and motive. That's not too hard. And here is what you can do to make it even easier, c'mon guys!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-737.wav|Smart move. The components are: access to the roof, weapon, and motive. Here is what you can do to make it easier, c'mon guys!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-771.wav|Nothing is happening. The pieces are there, but they remain unconnected.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-772.wav|Oh no, he's stuck again. Please, someone, just animate him. I got nothing.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-774.wav|Let's look at this as a learning experience. What are the components you need to implicate Ruby?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-793.wav|Still nothing, but that's okay. This doesn't have to turn into some kind of meltdown. You're just a cop taking your time to present a theory.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-799.wav|No one knows.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-864.wav|Of course. I should have known. Concentrate on tracking down Ruby.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-965.wav|I fear we just can't piece this puzzle together. At this point, the only sensible thing to do is get someone else to put the pieces together.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-971.wav|Suit yourself! But remember, you're the one putting yourself through this hassle.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-973.wav|Easy! If the lieutenant isn't here, you should find him and attempt this again while he's with you.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-980.wav|It's that simple.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1019.wav|Gladly.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1020.wav|Sure. Why not? Let's hear what some of our friends have to say.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1021.wav|It's very unlikely to help, but sure. We can go to Theory Town.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1024.wav|Let's move.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1045.wav|Really?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1046.wav|Absolutely nothing?

wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1134.wav|This guy barely understands what he's talking about.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1136.wav|It's called a... radio, you believe. The gardener may have played you again when she stormed out. She has her own plan.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1154.wav|You know this already. It all fits together: Ruby, the missing Hardie, was present at the hanging and running the drug trade.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-1155.wav|Say... Hard to remember with your brain in overload, but have you smoked lately? A cigarette may help you.

wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-123.wav|The containers in the yard are green in Wild Pines livery and the mountain rising behind Leo is all red in Union colours.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-124.wav|Everything is so pretty and red, you and Leo look like brothers as you glance around with similar childlike wonder.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-163.wav|Law school? Could he be talking about the Union fixer, AKA the gardener.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-209.wav|Yes, moving from inwards to outwards. By the looks of it soon everything will be in Union colours.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-230.wav|So Evrart trained a lawyer named Miss Beaufort. Interesting.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-97.wav|Okay, so that's basically his system here.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-189.wav|Clients would take a well-known multinational conglomerate over a local mobster any day.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-235.wav|This must be the woman who bought the gun from Roy, the one he described as "terrifying."
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-241.wav|Is this the same woman who bought the gun from Roy?
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-254.wav|You don't know his full plan. Perhaps he expected trickery? Perhaps the signatures weren't important? The point is: do not think you're ahead of him.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-282.wav|2,373 is a sizeable contingent for a labour organization in Revachol.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-319.wav|You should definitely come back here and ask again if you learn more about the Union's dealings. There's something he's not telling you.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-18.wav|That sounds a bit like organized crime.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-205.wav|Again: that sounds like organized crime.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-239.wav|There's more to this.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-462.wav|There's probably more to that.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-504.wav|He's betting on them being useless to you.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-533.wav|So he doesn't want to counter with a narrative that exonerates the Union. But why?
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-485.wav|That's not good, for you.
wavs/Logic-EVRART  COFFEE TABLE-33.wav|You would be correct.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-15.wav|There doesn't seem to be anything of interest here. No fine print. You're smart. You can read.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-22.wav|That was a nice move, yes.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-28.wav|Again, the document doesn't seem to have any hidden clause. Maybe, just maybe, what you see is what you get with Mr. Evrart?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-64.wav|That was a nice move, yes.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-88.wav|Putting the good of others before your own... You're a good man, Harry. A good and honourable man. And guns can be replaced, people can't.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-90.wav|No one would judge you. After all, what is a cop without his gun? Is he really even a cop anymore?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-136.wav|You are of course going to have to find a new weapon and hope you can finish this case without Evrart's help.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-140.wav|This is probably the smart choice. Now go mail the document and don't think about it anymore.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-141.wav|Okay. Cool. Honourable too. Just walk away with your head held high.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-154.wav|How very rational of you. Rational of Evrart, too, he will, no doubt, benefit from the village being abandoned.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  DOCUMENTS-179.wav|How very rational of you. Rational of Evrart, too, he will, no doubt, benefit from the village being abandoned.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  CLOAK JUMP-34.wav|Considering the limited police presence in Martinaise, you think we might take a leap of logic and say it's yours?
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  CLOAK JUMP-40.wav|You are the cop. It's your cloak. Don't make things complicated.
wavs/Logic-CONTAINERYARD  CLOAK JUMP-41.wav|Nailed it!
wavs/Logic-WALKWAY ORB  logic belt afterthought-2.wav|These are the same belts as the one the victim was hanged with.
wavs/Logic-WALKWAY ORB  logic belt afterthought-18.wav|Yes, this confirms Titus's story.
wavs/Logic-WALKWAY ORB  logic belt afterthought-20.wav|Indeed, it appears so. This is where the belt came from.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA ORB  col do ma ma daqua afterthought-6.wav|Lena also said that it couldn't be heard by any other animal, including humans. What you're hearing must just be a regular bird.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  mailbox-117.wav|It's not going to be that easy. Evrart wants you to dirty your hands getting these signatures and he will quickly find out if you just mail.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-406.wav|She's still here, because you're still here.
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-259.wav|Wouldn't a grave on top of a grave be just a big hole? What's hard about holes?
wavs/Logic-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-371.wav|Judging by that, van Eyck is some sort of musician. Or... killer?
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  ELECTRONIC DOORBELL-268.wav|East Delta Commerce Centre? This must be the name of the Doomed Commercial Area!
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  ICE CREAM MAKER-23.wav|Unplugging the ice cream maker will allow it to defrost.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  HIDDEN WEAPONS CACHE-66.wav|This is a good find. Really justifies coming down here and looking around.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  BARBELL-26.wav|Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to smash through that back door...
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  BARBELL-64.wav|It's just a memory.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  MOODBOARD-58.wav|Looks like they didn't make it.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-88.wav|Why did Fortress Accident have so many concept artists?
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-207.wav|And let's face it, they didn't have any money left for a legal action.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-432.wav|Password. Of course it would have a password. That's why there's a human administrator involved.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-456.wav|This must be the information Soona is looking for, she knows how to make sense of it.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  CURTAINS-27.wav|If this is really an entrance to the chimney then there must be a furnace somewhere as well. Maybe there's another way to get in?
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  CURTAINS-32.wav|This is directly above the central furnace in the cellar. The voices probably came from here.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  CURTAINS-66.wav|There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... Maybe you should talk to the lady in the bookstore, ask what's going on?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  NOTE FROM THE FRIDGE-71.wav|Someone who owns a radiocomputer, one might assume.
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  NOTE FROM THE FRIDGE-85.wav|It does, but who might that be?
wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  NOTE FROM THE FRIDGE-86.wav|You're welcome.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-47.wav|A beautiful woman tossing you a gift? Whatever you do, don't overthink it.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-473.wav|The doorbell with the empty name card must belong to her then.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-902.wav|Loving it. So nifty.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-910.wav|Oh, quite a lot of them spring to mind.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-913.wav|It's not really full of that. No one would store their drugs like that.
wavs/Logic-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-921.wav|They were just props. Why return to them?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-212.wav|It's like you felt it would be intellectually stimulating, and would lead somewhere. A custom even? Strange...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-277.wav|Trying to get a good picture of your jacket, no doubt.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-299.wav|You only have two, maybe three things left to say before the change runs out.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-419.wav|Seems like it did not have time to swallow the coin. This sometimes happens.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-546.wav|It's over.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 3-6.wav|That pain in your right side is your enlarged liver, by the way. As for your kidneys... you've really been compounding the damage lately.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 3-55.wav|Maybe if you cracked the damn thing, then you'd feel satisfied and tired. Holding the picture puzzle in your hands... complete!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 4-29.wav|Do it for the picture puzzle. Put it all together. Solve the world. One conversation at a time.
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  MORELL-185.wav|You should ask the redheaded boy. Cuno.
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  MORELL-491.wav|A meat-eating stick insect? Does it pretend to be the reeds as part of it's ambush behaviour? This seems unlikely.
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  MORELL-558.wav|He has clearly done his math on this. There is no surprising him, or swaying his opinion.
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  MORELL-630.wav|After this is your last chance to talk to Gary.
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  GARY-40.wav|But how is this combustible fluid lit?
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  GARY-300.wav|Yellow Man? Interesting. This is something to ask him about, after a little probing first...
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  GARY-366.wav|Yellow Man? Might this be the owner of that mug you found in the trash? This is something to ask him about, after a little probing first...
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  GARY-750.wav|This is a considerable expense to him. One month's wage, most likely.
wavs/Logic-COAST ORB  reeds by camp site-123.wav|No phasmid either, but still...
wavs/Logic-WESTCOAST  MORELL CRYPTIDS-5.wav|A moose that looks like any other moose... What's going on here? He's kidding right?
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-206.wav|There's a scenario unfolding in her head right now. It has nothing to do with what's happening here.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-279.wav|She didn't consume them. She didn't look high. She 'confiscated' them, a little like you are doing now.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK ORB  wielding your gun-53.wav|They don't.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-72.wav|NO! Remember, 'Get the gun, it's okay. It's safe'? It must have meant the gun is not loaded. She's holding an empty gun.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-206.wav|She's in a stupor. There's no telling when she'll snap out of it. If ever.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-251.wav|Reflex to what? Being left alone?
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-264.wav|The locals will take care of her. Someone's bound to know her family. Nothing you can do for her anymore.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-310.wav|Her children and their children, if there were any, stopped coming when it got really bad.
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  FELD MURAL-94.wav|Great idea!
wavs/Logic-BOARDWALK  FELD MURAL-197.wav|Why single out this one building?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-363.wav|She was 14 at the time.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-422.wav|There are plenty of other reasons for hiding your documents from the law.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-542.wav|The bills downstairs concur.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-730.wav|Yet? Maybe it's something she's keeping for a later move, when she's more sure of herself...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F2  MEDICINE CABINET-165.wav|Probably Garte's work. After she was arrested.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-134.wav|This would explain why no one heard the gunshot, the bullet came from far away.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-182.wav|It still remains an odd coincidence that there was a bunker there...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-462.wav|This is amateur ballistics. She left a trajectory for you...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-467.wav|This is amateur ballistics. She left a trajectory for you...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-476.wav|You need to understand where that shot came from, once and for all.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-515.wav|In the bookstore!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  BARRED DOOR-108.wav|Must be something valuable inside to go through the trouble of protecting it, the door is very sturdy indeed.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  BARRED DOOR-139.wav|The key... to the kitchen door. From behind the window. Use it on the door.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-257.wav|So that's why the phone is out of order. She tampered with the Whirling landline!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-258.wav|Jigsaw falling into place. This is satisfying. Good catch, I appreciate the symmetry.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-615.wav|You were right to suspect there might be foul play involved with the broken phone line!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-687.wav|Good. Yes. This means she could have heard something. Like what you were doing before you blacked out.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-725.wav|Jackpot!
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-729.wav|It's hard to know what to think about that answer.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-92.wav|She's quite observant about the human character, trained to observe, even...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-240.wav|That means his birthday is around February 28th.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-607.wav|She's quite observant about the human character, trained almost...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-637.wav|You should record her responses, but you do not have a notebook. Kim, on the other hand, does.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-690.wav|Everything left to be clarified is in the column on the left.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-10.wav|She did, of course.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-375.wav|He was a serviceman, he must have had a gun. Somewhere, lying around. Close to her hand...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-485.wav|Idiot? She's nothing of the sort.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-825.wav|This is a familiar theory. You had it too, remember? Could it be that Ruby was covering up after herself? The lynching...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1043.wav|This doesn't fit with the testimony of Titus Hardie. He said she was higher than usual.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1057.wav|Of course. Keep your eyes open for the killer instead.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1087.wav|They tampered with the body to disguise the cause of death.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1225.wav|Wait! If you arrest her, Kim will have to transport her. You'd be without your partner for the rest of the day...
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-37.wav|Could the massive property damage upstairs have anything to do with this?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-198.wav|He probably means this is where you step in and ask your questions.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-21.wav|Because he's not a bartender.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-326.wav|Relax. Knocking out the cafeteria manager is not going to solve your lodging problem, not in the long run.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-760.wav|Hmm... kitchen. It's right nearby. What if you asked the cook?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-766.wav|Hmm... the kitchen is close by, maybe the cook will be more forthcoming?
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1000.wav|Yeah, those numbers he's adding up must be making good sense to him right now.
wavs/Logic-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1220.wav|It's safe to say this is about your karaoke performance.
wavs/Logic-JAM  TOMMY-521.wav|Then she may have dyed it again.
wavs/Logic-JAM  TOMMY-552.wav|Hmh... the grey haired woman. Maybe she knows something?
wavs/Logic-JAM  TOMMY-556.wav|One of them you haven't even questioned yet. Maybe the third driver knows something?
wavs/Logic-JAM  TOMMY-588.wav|If they break in they would find what's hidden inside? Something incriminating?
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT ORB  quiet on the island-55.wav|No, it's just your imagination. You can't hear such things.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT INT  SPRING MATTRESS-9.wav|Someone has been squatting here. Very recently.

wavs/Logic-SEAFORT INT  BLAST DOOR-82.wav|The chances of there being 'important shit' there are rather high, yes.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-1036.wav|He doesn't recognize it.

wavs/Logic-INVENTORY  KLAASJE PASSPORT-74.wav|Klaasje's hidden documents. That she said would be in a buoy on the coast.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-72.wav|THE SOLUTION.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-236.wav|Exhaust him with proof. Pile it all on him, get a confession.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-249.wav|That's right. Pile it all on him now. Three should do it, maybe four...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-293.wav|Wait, here it comes, the god damn May bells, the dried may bells on Klaasje's roof!
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-300.wav|Wait, here it comes, the god damn May bells, the dried may bells on Klaasje's roof!
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-303.wav|There were May bells in the grass when you got here! They're revolutionary symbols, from the war!
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-304.wav|Who cares, there were May bells in the grass when you got here!  And on Klaasje's balcony!
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-305.wav|There were May bells in the grass when you got here! And may bells on Klaasje's balcony!
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-332.wav|He knows her, but hadn't heard the name.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-482.wav|The vision was you remembering that.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-536.wav|You got him going. Connect every little piece now. Wrap this up like a gift...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-540.wav|When? Before or after the war?
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-568.wav|The motive! This is where the motive is going to come from...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-580.wav|No, not shush! He could say he was taking the fall for someone. Insane. Coerced. It's useless in court without a motive, don't mess this up...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-588.wav|Now, a motive! You still need a motive, the confession alone isn't enough...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-600.wav|He could say he was taking the fall for someone. Insane. Coerced. It's useless in court without a motive, don't mess this up...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-803.wav|Don't leave any loose ends. Get him on everything.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-804.wav|You've almost got him. Just a last little push...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-805.wav|Tie up every loose end, now. There's no other chance.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-806.wav|Leave no stone unturned! Get him on what matters most!

wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-108.wav|A little inconsistency, he was surprised to hear her name Klaasje, before. Would he not have seen it on the documents?
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-229.wav|Rightly so. Fix this now! Push on, extra carefully!
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-293.wav|Also, a little inconsistency here, he was surprised to hear her name Klaasje, before. Would he not have seen it on the documents?

wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-443.wav|Here it is. The bend in the river...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-590.wav|That's, regrettably, all you've got, yes.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-773.wav|That's it! That's what you weren't connecting yourself...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-56.wav|But then, who watches him, while you're coming back here?
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-72.wav|There's something you're not getting here that he's realizing.

wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-219.wav|He's right. You've lost your mind.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-366.wav|But that means...
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-672.wav|Wait! But then, who watches over him while you're coming back?
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-692.wav|There's something you're not getting here that he has just realized.
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-697.wav|Lilienne. You could ask her maybe?
wavs/Logic-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-698.wav|Lilienne. You could ask her.

wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  HJELMWOMAN-47.wav|Good god this is some retrograde stuff. When was this shit written?
wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  WIRRAL MODULE-32.wav|It's not. It's for pansies. Man from Hjelmdall is way more awesome.
wavs/Rhetoric-BOOKSTORE  MAP WALL-39.wav|The place does not look like a successful tourist trap, does it?
wavs/Rhetoric-BOOKSTORE  PARANORMAL-17.wav|These three things are very important to the working-class mind.
wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-440.wav|But not good enough, the lieutenant seems to be saying.
wavs/Rhetoric-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-27.wav|He's deflecting. He's young, with a sharp memory. He hasn't had time to drown it in booze and chemicals.
wavs/Rhetoric-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-62.wav|That's definitely not his real name.
wavs/Rhetoric-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-95.wav|Martin Martinaise? Good local name. Let's go with that.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-17.wav|She's truly desperate, she thinks she has no other options. You need to give her options.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-18.wav|You should know the words to say. You've been here yourself. So why is it not coming to you?
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-189.wav|Because you think suicide might be a good course of action for you too. Her finger squeezes the trigger now...
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-190.wav|Because you've been going around pointing a gun at yourself, trying to answer the same question in vain. Her finger squeezes the trigger now...
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-191.wav|Because you've misread the situation from the beginning. And now her finger squeezes the trigger...
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-239.wav|No, wait, finally, it comes to you, a way to connect with her:
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-277.wav|So she thinks of you as hunters, not cops, and of herself merely as prey.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-304.wav|A strong moral compass. She still wants the opportunity to make a case for herself.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-403.wav|As opposed to the other knives she's finding there now. Hardie, for one.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-410.wav|That's her admitting the bullet was an emergency exit.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-479.wav|You know.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-582.wav|She likes telling you about the machine. Keep her talking, look for an opportunity to break loose.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  beware shivers-22.wav|It's not a quib. The situation is dangerous.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  beware shivers-39.wav|He just can't be sure, maybe it will yield something useful?
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  KRAS MAZOV PORTRAIT-21.wav|The lieutenant does not seem to share your enthusiasm.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  KRAS MAZOV PORTRAIT-33.wav|The lieutenant does not seem to share your enthusiasm.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-231.wav|She deliberately avoided naming the mob she worked for. You might be able to find this out later.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-251.wav|She's beginning to suspect you've broken into her lorry now.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  wearing revolutionary hat-2.wav|This hat is so soft, so warm. It wraps around your head... and your mind tingles with all manner of socio-economic theory.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  wearing revolutionary hat-3.wav|Kras Mazov would have worn this ushanka. Mazov knew where to cook those thoughts, that's why it bears a Mazovian logo.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  wearing revolutionary hat-4.wav|Glory to the Revolution, comrade! Whether you like it or not, wearing this hat has made you more communist.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  wearing revolutionary hat-7.wav|Let's hope no one saw you wearing that outrageously communist hat.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-67.wav|She's being evasive. She knows something.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-686.wav|She is not impressed by a cop running errands for a local big wig. Not at all.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-756.wav|In her mind, the Union is right wing because Evrart is fat. It's that simple and there's no changing it.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  NOID-587.wav|What a strange choice of words...
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  NOID-616.wav|This speedfreak does not quite understand the sudden escalation of emotion in that argument, but he agrees nonetheless.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ACELE CHURCH STUFF-9.wav|Indeed. She merely tried to omit the truth instead.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ACELE CHURCH STUFF-183.wav|She's less prone to blurting out 'crab-man!' than the others.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-127.wav|This is a below feeble attempt at avoidance. Basically, he is attempting to weaponise idiocy.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-256.wav|A pincer manoeuvre.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-281.wav|Why not! Let's go with that.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  EGGHEAD-402.wav|The young man drops his oversized head in shame. He is truly sorry he couldn't come up with a profitable market strategy.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-26.wav|What are you, a petulant child? He expects you to apologize.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-54.wav|You definitely could have handled that better.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE-72.wav|If you don't know what the Founding Party is, there might be a way to mask it with minor demagoguery.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE-311.wav|A half-hearted sell of something which does not seem worth buying.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE-350.wav|That means they haven't set up a single one yet.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-446.wav|You could probably justify taking 70%. The risks are greater for you as a police officer.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-690.wav|All this eloquence, it's in service of something. She's afraid.
wavs/Rhetoric-ICE  ACELE-679.wav|To the cops.
wavs/Rhetoric-LANDS END  NETPICKER-173.wav|She means her kids.
wavs/Rhetoric-LANDS END  NETPICKER-179.wav|You should say something. Anything. Maybe the Tequila Sunset thing?
wavs/Rhetoric-LANDS END ORB  lands end shot viscal-44.wav|No what?
wavs/Rhetoric-LANDS END ORB  lands end shot viscal-60.wav|Technically speaking that would be a...
wavs/Rhetoric-LANDS END  DEPOT DOOR-25.wav|No-no, we've absolutely gotten into everywhere thus far. That's what we do, we open doors and go through them. We're cops, that's our perk.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  RENE-338.wav|He doesn't think it was an excellent job at all, he's disappointed.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  RENE-349.wav|It's clear these words mean a lot to him.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  RENE-412.wav|The bane of horses.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  RENE-525.wav|He's just making excuses for the king's habits, isn't he?
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON-293.wav|Teacup? Oh, because of the ceramic armour. Clever.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  RENE WC HERO STORY-112.wav|Well, if you phrase it like that it doesn't sound too good.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON CASE-16.wav|He means caviar-socialists.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON CASE-86.wav|'Where were we', what a joyous way of putting it.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON CASE-96.wav|He just fluffs it up.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-5.wav|All right, this is how we're gonna do it:
wavs/alternative-0-Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-5-0.wav|All right, this is how we're gonna do it. Diplomacy or blackmail. Blackmail is quick and efficient. Leaves less loose ends.. 
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-9.wav|A man so principled about his sandwich calls for a principled approach. Time to get political.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-74.wav|Sorry, but at this point, all that's left to do is beg and hope for the best. Beg like you've never begged before.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-79.wav|Say one of these fascist or communist things or fuck off.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-81.wav|It's probably for the best. People don't like beggars.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-87.wav|No. You're gonna starve to death.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-105.wav|No time to bring him in. Just keep your eyes on the prize and ignore him.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-149.wav|Too late. Daddy's already fighting the bad fight. Make it stick.
wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  GIANT HAM SANDWICH-90.wav|It's a little joke the lieutenant made. He knows what you meant.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING  SLEEPING DOCKWORKER-183.wav|Meaning: you're not gonna get more out of me.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GORACY KUBEK-66.wav|I'm pretty sure he asked you a question.
wavs/Rhetoric-FRITTE  KNICK-KNACKS STAND-82.wav|She says 'fuck with Frittte' like it's a saying, or like she's quoting someone. Maybe you can ask her about this later?
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-51.wav|The scene is making even him feel as though he has to justify your actions.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-68.wav|He was too sarcastic for you to realize who he was.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-189.wav|Good idea. It doesn't look like he thinks you're in a position to correct him on the shitkid issue.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-281.wav|He's got a very, very solid case there. Actually, I've been trying to find a good moment to tell you...
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-286.wav|Yes. You often sound like a brutal idiot.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-289.wav|Listen to yourself. You sound like a brutal idiot. No matter what I do.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-376.wav|Meaning: you forgot both who you are and the definitions of 'money,' 'isola,' 'pale,' and so on.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-843.wav|You may have accidentally admitted to losing it. Just now.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-883.wav|If you investigated further, you, or Kim, would have more to say. But you didn't, so here we are.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE-890.wav|If you investigated further, you would have more to say. But you didn't. So here we are.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-9.wav|It's so much better if he does this. A million times better.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-54.wav|You should yell something.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-90.wav|Yes. Let's let the big boys talk.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-176.wav|There! You need to make your case, now. The floor is all yours, he prepared it well.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-230.wav|You may want to rethink your strategy of letting a 12 year old present your case.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-527.wav|Get the kid in line. You could use his help here.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-681.wav|Put the best proof forth. As solid as you've got.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-877.wav|That's it. The argument is lost.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-931.wav|Now you make your case. Now is the time. Now or never.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-16.wav|For Revachol.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-17.wav|For the planetary proletariat.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-18.wav|For the Revachol Citizens Militia. A blue forget-me-not in the grey sky.

wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-97.wav|The farce needs to end. Everyone sees that.
wavs/Rhetoric-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-365.wav|This truly came as a surprise to him. Not a bad one. But he's at a loss.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  ELEVATOR-47.wav|It appears his whole enthusiasm is sarcastic.
wavs/Rhetoric-LAIR ORB  dark celebration-75.wav|He doesn't actually believe it's wonderful.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA ORB  spirit bomb ready-148.wav|I can talk you out of it, whatever it is.

wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-163.wav|Oh yes! She'll come around now. I made her love you again, Harry.
wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-174.wav|I don't understand. It was... she herself said...
wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-460.wav|You need to recite it to her. For effect. All of it. No summaries.
wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-527.wav|It wouldn't be a cheap rental this time...
wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-528.wav|You're a better man now. With a rank, in a powerful, armed organization.
wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-529.wav|A cheap rental... with mold on the walls, and the tap dripping.
wavs/Rhetoric-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-536.wav|Nothing will. I've been poisoned by newspaper and news. All I can do is scream at them and think of her, secretly.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-220.wav|It's impossible to say whether she's being sarcastic or really means it.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-279.wav|She doesn't actually think it's all that extraordinary.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-280.wav|She remains unconvinced...
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  TRASH-261.wav|Wow, went off script there, getting your ass handed to you. You shouldn't go picking fights if your rhetorical faculties haven't suggested it.
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-369.wav|He's not going to let you steal his thunder twice.
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-459.wav|Note to self: this would be a good question to ask Titus, where's the eighth man?
wavs/Rhetoric-LEDGER WAKEUP-95.wav|He replies with such understanding it's as if the burnt out ruins of the past were an occupational hazard, athlete's foot for cops.
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  HANGED MAN-996.wav|He doesn't mean it in earnest. It's a cruel jest. He's going to say as much too, just you wait:
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  HANGED MAN-1187.wav|Clearly Cuno would like to interject something here, but there's not enough for him to hold on to.
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  HANGED MAN-1193.wav|If you can't experiment, how will you learn?
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  HANGED MAN-1368.wav|You really need to learn the difference, buddy. This is embarrassing.
wavs/Rhetoric-YARD  HANGED MAN-1422.wav|To the gates! Let's negotiate!
wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-253.wav|But they appear... pleasantly vague.
wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-476.wav|(Cause of failure: rent too high.)
wavs/Rhetoric-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-281.wav|'Okay,' he's thinking. 'I can do this. Let's do this. Who'd want to sit on an anthill? There are no therapeutic benefits to..."
wavs/Rhetoric-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-308.wav|It's as if he knows what it stands for, but wants you to say it. It's pedagogical.
wavs/Rhetoric-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-463.wav|Looks like this might take a while. Time to present a good topic for discussion.
wavs/Rhetoric-PAWNSHOP  ROY-524.wav|There's no way to turn this around, I'm afraid.
wavs/Rhetoric-PAWNSHOP  ROY-536.wav|He won't be your narc, but he won't be thrilled about this either.
wavs/Rhetoric-PAWNSHOP  ROY-539.wav|The rest is for him, to compensate for the pain of being separated from his radiant spinners.
wavs/Rhetoric-PAWNSHOP  TABLE OF KNICKKNACKS-88.wav|He doesn't elaborate on what that means, it's unlikely that he will.
wavs/Rhetoric-PAWNSHOP  TABLE OF KNICKKNACKS-89.wav|He doesn't elaborate on these 'wrong hands', it's unlikely that he ever will.
wavs/Rhetoric-PAWNSHOP  RACK OF SECOND-HAND UNIFORMS-114.wav|Wow, what?
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-167.wav|It's a law that keeps Revachol what it is, in limbo.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-221.wav|Why what? Stop thinking. Take her down.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-227.wav|Charge! You've got the guns and the ammo.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-229.wav|Have it your way.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-262.wav|Yup. That's the stuff.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-456.wav|An opening gambit, surely.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-542.wav|She's being sarcastic. Don't take her performance literally.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-853.wav|It's implied she's open to discussing this matter with you at a later occasion.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-986.wav|Her tone makes clear that you've violated some kind of rich-person taboo. Wouldn't be the first time.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1342.wav|She's not actually considering it. It's sarcasm.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1462.wav|There's a trace of irony in his voice. Mischief even. This is a tactic.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1470.wav|Ludicrous, even, it's meant.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1509.wav|Meaning: the information she has will raise the stakes in this game.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-163.wav|She's picked a strange hill to die on. Strike!
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-173.wav|Should have cornered her. Maybe it would have yielded something...
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-470.wav|Feels like there's a good response here, but you're not coming up with one. Carry on.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-474.wav|The situation at the gates is a powder keg. She says she wants to avert catastrophe but that's where she draws the line? I call bullshit.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  CINDY-420.wav|She means the opposite.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  CINDY-437.wav|She'd never admit to it anyway.
wavs/Rhetoric-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-4.wav|Now's your chance, ask her who she is, she won't get out this time.
wavs/Rhetoric-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-165.wav|Not so fast, who is she in all this? Ask her who she is, she owes you an answer.
wavs/Rhetoric-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-346.wav|It takes time for the apes to change. And work. Perhaps what happened here was part of that time, and part of that work.
wavs/Rhetoric-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-349.wav|We, she's one of them. Of course.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-342.wav|In case he goes down later, souring the entire portfolio.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-372.wav|There may be a way to get her speaking about herself, at some later juncture.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-754.wav|There's a slippery article in there...
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-768.wav|Who says and who argues?
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-938.wav|This is not going to happen with the lieutenant present, unless you can convince him to step aside.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-952.wav|He's being sarcastic.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-279.wav|She is more defensive about it than usual.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-346.wav|A constrictor knot of contrary motives: greed, fear. There may be a way to affect her through these microscopics...
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-416.wav|Each of those expeditions would have been led by an admiral. Sounds like a purge. Like she was purging her political rivals.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-476.wav|There are no employers. She's a member of the board. Probably a partner.
wavs/alternative-0-Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-477-0.wav|Forget about that, what was that about the Age of Capital only beginning? You need to talk politics with this lady.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-580.wav|Of all the things to be stuck looping this has got to be one of the most witless.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-790.wav|So it was a factor in her coming to Martinaise in the first place? Interesting.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-860.wav|Not be too rare an occurrence.
wavs/Rhetoric-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-904.wav|Let's keep it that way, she means to add, but then doesn't.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-30.wav|Rhetorical flare. He does not actually welcome the return of the whores.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-96.wav|He did not expect you both to survive once you stepped between those two armies.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-212.wav|No. They would be here if they were truly worried.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-224.wav|Sorry.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-338.wav|He's wrong!
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-509.wav|By the way, the lieutenant does not actually believe you will be spiritually reimbursed for letting her escape. You just have to live with it.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-35.wav|Sounds like he's alright after all.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-167.wav|He's wrong! What does he even know?!
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  GRAFFITO-95.wav|The return of light.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-32.wav|The way the last word is emphasized suggests a veiled threat to your person.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-250.wav|It sincerely amuses him, how hard these guys typecast themselves.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  EUGENE AND ALAIN-38.wav|He said 'thank you'.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  EUGENE AND ALAIN-112.wav|He probably means they've been mourning their lost friends.
wavs/Rhetoric-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-133.wav|Apparently he has never formed an opinion on the matter and isn't going to do so on the fly either.
wavs/Rhetoric-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-164.wav|This is the extent of the boy's knowledge.
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-19.wav|Here we go. Zoom in on the mixed races part. It's the best one.
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-34.wav|Wait a second. Are you sure you want to go there? Even if you succeed, you're going to fail.
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-37.wav|Are you sure about that?
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-39.wav|Hoo boy, we're really doing this.
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-60.wav|Now you're thinking sensibly.
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-69.wav|Okay. You think there's a way out of this.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-194.wav|You're pretty sure you can live in a tree elsewhere too, but he wouldn't believe it anyway.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-254.wav|Because you need to solve the biggest case in the history of criminal sciences.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-310.wav|A bold move! Let's see if it pays off.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-329.wav|After all this mess, the broken seals, lying to you? C'mon!
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-447.wav|Start with a little compliment, then work your way up from there, this is about business, remember.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-450.wav|No need to dress this one up, just tell him what you want.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-453.wav|He's not ruling her out.

wavs/Rhetoric-JAM ORB  pagetwothought-14.wav|L'origine du disco! Such a powerful conceit, and this is what we're going to do with it? The commitment of an act of gross public indecency?
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  PALEDRIVER-93.wav|In all likelihood, it's a world that's only ever existed in her mind.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  PALEDRIVER-278.wav|Those epithets are familiar somehow, The Great Adversary, The Great Unrest.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  PALEDRIVER-374.wav|No elaboration.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-183.wav|All, seven, together. They're diluting responsibility. It's an anti-arrest tactic.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-194.wav|This isn't something he came up with on the spot. It's his standard reasoning, a product of many years of being Titus Hardie.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-238.wav|"...that there's any question who's the leader." That's how he would have ended it. Titus won't let him.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-354.wav|Girls plural? There's another girl? Two of them? Take note of this. They'll probably say more about her later.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-402.wav|Yes. No more small talk.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-476.wav|I do not understand. They're just stupid, probably. Too stupid to understand the arguments. Maybe the lieutenant could do it for you.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-269.wav|So much bluster to hide the fact that they're uncomfortable with you having this info.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-193.wav|He's desperately trying to offer a counter-narrative. There is none.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1   MERC TRIBUNAL WARNING-102.wav|That was an unsure phrasing.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-161.wav|Behind his squinting eyes, dominoes are falling, fast. It's all beginning to make sense to him now.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-242.wav|You're going to have to be way more blunt here.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-524.wav|Just don't contradict yourself. If it doesn't sound like 'RUBY DID IT', maybe keep it to yourself?
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-667.wav|He must be referencing some past case of theirs.

wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-232.wav|Whatever you do, don't ask him about the gun first. You don't want him thinking you're scared.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-670.wav|He's hiding his real reaction beneath courtesy.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-677.wav|He refuses to discuss it further. It's probably just a small nuisance to him.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-46.wav|He respects that word, that's obvious.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-275.wav|Look at him, it's not gonna be anything useful anyway. Don't fight it. Better to go with the flow.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-280.wav|Telling the gardener you know her name might throw her off? Perhaps something to consider, later...
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART ME-17.wav|This translates into: "Ha-ha, you guys are so corrupt."

wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART HOW I GOT HERE-42.wav|Yes, but it's because his word usually sets things in motion.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART GUN-10.wav|The only way to find it seems to be working with him. He might even be holding your gun hostage...
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART GUN-38.wav|Who knows? Only one thing is certain: If you work with him, you're going to get it back, and working with him might be the only way to do it.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-172.wav|Actually, no, it's not.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-423.wav|Is he absolutely sure the tenants won't be thrown out in the street?
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-439.wav|He's saying as little as possible as vaguely as he can. Deliberately omitting things.

wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-481.wav|Actually, at the level this guy is, it takes several generations to do that, but all right.
wavs/Rhetoric-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-22.wav|You cannot but notice the prospect of you telling Joyce about your conversations is actually pleasing Evrart.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 5-10.wav|This bastard isn't even listening to you!
wavs/Rhetoric-WESTCOAST  MORELL-28.wav|That's sarcasm. He takes no pleasure from your appearance.
wavs/Rhetoric-WESTCOAST  MORELL-380.wav|It's clear that his obsession with the phasmid is driven by something more than the pure pursuit of scientific advancement.

wavs/Rhetoric-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-78.wav|Mark my words, all of this somehow ties to the history of Occidential financial markets.
wavs/Rhetoric-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-83.wav|Man, he's good at speaking. People must love him.
wavs/Rhetoric-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-178.wav|He means that 'the boys' got shot by the communists. 'The boys' were bourgeois.
wavs/Rhetoric-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-295.wav|No, I mean, c'mon, you need the money. If it's not a thing, he can give you some.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-630.wav|Question avoided. Let's conclude that she has admirers. Plenty of them.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-964.wav|It's hard to tell if she means it in earnest or as a joke.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F2  MEDICINE CABINET-114.wav|There is little condescension in his phrasing, more measured curiosity.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  BARRED DOOR-153.wav|You should have gloated.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-94.wav|The wording, a verbal eye roll. She's almost disgusted with the platitude you served up.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-410.wav|It's impossible to say whether she's being sarcastic or really means it.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-563.wav|That is correct. And omissions too.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-741.wav|'Rapeable'? What an unfortunate choice of words. Does she really mean that some people are more...?
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-765.wav|'Spicier'. Of course. Rape's nothing but a plot device for these guys, to throw around as they wish.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-64.wav|She doesn't care. If anything, she sounds amused.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-183.wav|He's lying.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-453.wav|What is this, an interrogation? You didn't tell her this was going to be an interrogation.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-455.wav|Is she avoiding anything? Technically not.
wavs/Rhetoric-KIM SWITCH  KLAASJE REACTION-37.wav|Whatever you do, don't say the first thing.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-183.wav|She says it quickly. Like she's said it a hundred times, to herself? To get used to the idea?
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-564.wav|Who, me? The lady is saintly, oh she sucks on the cigarette most elegantly. Stop staring, you look mentally handicapped.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-744.wav|Yes. Start at the top, choose at the bottom, it's how we've always done it. No rush...
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-759.wav|She purposefully misrepresented information crucial to the case.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3 ORB  age afterthought-35.wav|She's buying time to formulate the best answer.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE END-67.wav|So she thinks, at least partly, that this Return will feature a self-governing Revachol. She has already placed her bets.

wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-569.wav|He smiles until he realizes his comeback wasn't very good. Then he frowns again.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-609.wav|He's shaken. Barter now and he'll cave in.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-79.wav|Play it calm. This man needs to understand you need a drink to help the community deal with police-stuff.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-90.wav|Everything is political.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-504.wav|Okay then. (Maybe you're callous yourself...)
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-505.wav|Prod at him and find out!
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-605.wav|You need to approach this situation logically. Ask him why he has the PA system installed, if you can't use it.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-849.wav|He's almost completely forgotten what this began with.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-979.wav|It's.... not actually about that. But he liked it.
wavs/Rhetoric-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1044.wav|Against the Doom, it's implied.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  TOMMY-374.wav|Relax, he's merely joking.
wavs/Rhetoric-JAM  TOMMY-738.wav|He doesn't blame them. But he's not on their side, that's for sure.

wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT INT  MICROGRID GENERATOR-106.wav|If anyone's stayed here, they'd need a generator.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT INT  READING MATERIALS-52.wav|Your incendiary remark has failed to provoke him.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT INT  READING MATERIALS-120.wav|He has no idea what that means.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT INT  READING MATERIALS-166.wav|It's hard to get a good argument on, when your partner gets shot and you're alone.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT INT  READING MATERIALS-168.wav|This means we have a critical theory loving vagrant here... interesting.

wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-576.wav|He does not believe a police officer is genuinely revolutionary.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-727.wav|Now hold on there...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-999.wav|This looked very much like the murder weapon. It can be used against him, later.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-1006.wav|This looked very much like the murder weapon. It can be used against him to get a confession, in time...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-1041.wav|He would answer, but something happened. It's like his tape cut off suddenly...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-207.wav|There is uncertainty in his phrasing.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-841.wav|He cannot believe what he's saying too much.
wavs/Rhetoric-INVENTORY  KLAASJE PASSPORT-157.wav|By now, the lieutenant has accepted your unusual methods.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-66.wav|He sounds like he hasn't gotten to speak to another human being in a long time. Especially about politics. That's what you should do first.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-76.wav|Go in straight, no euphemisms, he doesn't like those...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-183.wav|You're getting diverted. Push the gun. Only the gun matters.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-238.wav|He's practically admitting to it.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-389.wav|This is it. Shot him, shot him, say shot him not killed him...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-9.wav|Joyce... he means Joyce.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-289.wav|This implies that he's thought about extorting her.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-312.wav|There! He's already admitted to it! Just ask...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-504.wav|Joyce... he means Joyce again.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-540.wav|Those two took the cake.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-549.wav|Seems like the answer was yes.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-564.wav|He knew she knows. She was looking at the island, figuring it out, day by day, cigarette by cigarette...
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-53.wav|He is indeed very lucid at times..
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-141.wav|Now wait a moment. Let's get serious here.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-239.wav|Not only.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-298.wav|Disappointment, so personal. He displays a familiarity with the Union's top brass.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-360.wav|They let him be here. 'Understanding' was a courtesy, but why such a courtesy?
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-364.wav|Okay, he didn't do the hanged man for them. But he's insinuating something.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-389.wav|That is a euphemism.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-448.wav|Just say nothing.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-696.wav|The words come to you, clear as day.
wavs/Rhetoric-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-729.wav|Nothing, 'nothing' is what he tried to say.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  KORTENAER-128.wav|Shit, this is it. Tell him anything, tell him you have more information!
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  KORTENAER-314.wav|She doesn't seem to understand the severity of the situation.
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  KORTENAER-330.wav|Wait. It's a good thing you have an anthropomorphic petrol bomb. It really is. But you have to soften him up first. Present an argument!

wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  SCAB LEADER-31.wav|His manner of speaking is wooden, the tone of voice bland and uninspired. Almost as if compiling replies from a set of learned phrases.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  SCAB LEADER-239.wav|Silence is the answer. There's something off here but he won't say what.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  SCAB LEADER-247.wav|Odd out of place colonial reference there, Mr. Scab Leader...

wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-93.wav|No doubt he's communist enough to call himself such. But he won't.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-224.wav|But certainly you have to form an opinion on everything and then tell it to everyone.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-453.wav|Come on. He's just trying to keep the peace.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-528.wav|It's implied he finds it unlikely that you will succeed in this.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-607.wav|He means he's not gonna tell you, 'cause he doesn't know. But he will shoot his mouth off with you now that you're working for Evrart.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-668.wav|You've been in there, he means, talked to the boss man too probably...
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-698.wav|This man has political theory, and it has not failed him today.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-703.wav|This was great. You feel mentally reinvigorated.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-725.wav|He says it matter-of-factly. Like it's no big deal.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MANANA-735.wav|Feels like he's hinting at something, but you're too hungover (or dumb) to understand right now.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-254.wav|Does this remind you of someone? The guy down there...
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-343.wav|There's a but.
wavs/Rhetoric-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-753.wav|Was there an out of this for you with success. Or was the rhetoric game rigged? I can't tell...
wavs/Rhetoric-PLAZA  KORTENAER-366.wav|No, no. It's okay. Soften him up and trust the others to attack if it comes to that. Make him talk! Present an argument!

wavs/Drama-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-67.wav|It would take more subterfuge to trick the lieutenant.
wavs/Drama-YARD  HANGED MAN-93.wav|A white lie.
wavs/Drama-YARD  HANGED MAN-1038.wav|Not you at all, no-no-no!
wavs/Drama-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-39.wav|The tune on your lips forms a strange, yet undeniably beautiful contrast with the surrounding bleakness.
wavs/Drama-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-40.wav|Spit flies from your mouth to your moustache, your chest, the ground before you... No sound though.
wavs/alternative-0-Drama-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-40-0.wav|Spit flies from your mouth, spraying your chest and landing on the ground before you. No sound though.
wavs/Drama-SOUTHCOAST  SUNKEN MOTOR CARRIAGE-274.wav|He's gloating at you. Oh, it's so easy for Mr. Teacher!
wavs/Drama-PAWNSHOP  ROY-86.wav|He considered it, but his priority was to get rid of the gun as quickly as possible, albeit for a price.
wavs/Drama-PAWNSHOP  ROY-546.wav|He doesn't know anything.
wavs/Drama-PAWNSHOP  ROY-585.wav|People as oleaginous as Evrart seem like they're lying even when they're really being truthful.
wavs/Drama-KIM SWITCH  PAWNSHOP-29.wav|He doesn't really think you're a superstar or that you're well-off. He's only playing along because it's expedient.
wavs/Drama-PAWNSHOP  RACK OF SECOND-HAND UNIFORMS-112.wav|Lie, sire. For no reason.
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-326.wav|What situation?
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1350.wav|No way. She's more. She can make decisions.
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-424.wav|She's being truthful. She is pressing them as hard as she can.
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  JOYCE-9.wav|Something about the way she says it makes you want to sing.
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-3.wav|Yes, reality is your side-case.
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-137.wav|My liege, this woman has half-convinced herself already. All it would take is a little nudge...
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-172.wav|Of course. Brinkmanship takes showmanship. We should have seen it before, in his office. He might well have been performing for us.
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-737.wav|Hmm... perhaps he is?
wavs/Drama-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-819.wav|Could it be all my fellows have failed? Alack and alas, sire! Forgive me! I shall do my best to end this pantomime...
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-332.wav|He is definitely not on La Puta Madre's take.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  KIM WAKEUP-444.wav|He may have some idea, but he's not gonna get into it with you.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-145.wav|He's telling the truth.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-153.wav|He did.
wavs/Drama-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-107.wav|Good. Talk to him, demonstratively pick it up, then push it along with the other accusations. This is a good idea.
wavs/Drama-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-139.wav|A convincing performance, bravo!
wavs/Drama-JAM  PALEDRIVER-140.wav|In the background you can hear the orchestra swell as the screen fills with the maiden's imploring eyes...
wavs/Drama-JAM  RACIST-632.wav|He's surprisingly good at this. Not bad at all... Look at him lurching.
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-478.wav|She's genuinely rooting for you, sire!
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-744.wav|Sire, she doth not believe it wasn't you.
wavs/Drama-APT  WCW MAIN-323.wav|A very good call.
wavs/Drama-APT  WCW MAIN-324.wav|A very good call. You must leave now, sire.
wavs/Drama-APT  WCW MAIN-339.wav|For god's sake. Lie.
wavs/Drama-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-289.wav|He holds out his hands and blossoms his fingers, like a drama teacher setting the scene.
wavs/Drama-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-534.wav|Hypothetically sssspeaking, you might add.
wavs/Drama-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-560.wav|Now's your chance, ssssire. Which of your enemies would you most like to make trouble for?
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING  KIM INTRO-47.wav|Not for a moment does he believe that's your real name. He casts it aside as an intradepartmental joke or a peculiarity he doesn't understand.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-650.wav|LIE! LIE TO GET OUT OF IT!
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-14.wav|Her entire character has shifted. This young woman is cold as ice.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-153.wav|A man like Easy Leo could have said anything. Do not be restrained, sire.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-220.wav|Strange. It's as if people don't believe a cop could be a socialist revolutionary.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-275.wav|It's not her. She's not a Hardie girl. Definitely.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-52.wav|Do not let their squeals disturb your serenity. These are but simple peasants, sire.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-141.wav|Just keep it simple. He said they killed him. These uninitiated do not understand the fineries of Runic Science.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-19.wav|Let's call this one The Musician.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-181.wav|They're confused. This is growing over their heads.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-143.wav|He's working really, really hard to spin this. It's not easy.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-5.wav|Sire, it would be an event most dramatic if you were to produce the bullet and dangle it before their very eyes!
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-56.wav|...or lie. Something he's probably not very good at.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-80.wav|All the goofing around is to avoid lying. It's a technique.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-111.wav|Oh my god, The Art, they're using it against you. This is all a twisted phantasie!
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-103.wav|That's a lie.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-109.wav|When he said "don't worry" he actually meant "be very worried."
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-425.wav|It's not gonna be as easy this time.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-566.wav|Not for one second did he believe there's an actual mega rich person somewhere in his containertown.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-651.wav|He's playing it cool, but he knows his ploy didn't work.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-668.wav|The reaction appears to be sincere, but... it's impossible to tell with this guy, honestly.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART FAVORS-48.wav|He sincerely has no idea what you were talking about, and he doesn't care either.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MR DU BOIS-3.wav|"Don't you worry, I've got plenty on you too, my rigid friend."
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-22.wav|Well done, sire. By guile and deceit, you're in.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-110.wav|Good, now take it a bit further. Take it home.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-111.wav|You didn't say it with nearly enough confidence.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-114.wav|A guy who has antagonized the Union in a Union-run town? Maybe it's political?
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-121.wav|He was testing you. You succeeded.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-131.wav|He's trying to figure out if you're lying.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-38.wav|Wait... there was no mention of a casserole from Joyce.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-263.wav|You get a strange feeling, looking at that smile. It spoils the moment. It is disingenuous.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-102.wav|I'm wondering if the poetics come with the jacket or are they derived from something else entirely?
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  ELECTRONIC DOORBELL-34.wav|She thinks you're the gremlin child! What would he say to this?
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  ELECTRONIC DOORBELL-172.wav|Who cares that you don't remember her? Just go along with it.
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-679.wav|Maybe it's just because she's so talented that she's been able to woo the curse?
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-131.wav|Sssssssshe's lying. Probably hated it. They all did.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-126.wav|He might be wearing a disguise.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-88.wav|He's assuming a role to mock you, or to entertain himself with your ignorance. Don't fall for it!
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 3-35.wav|Put on your prettiest face for the masses!
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  DREAM 3-53.wav|Thou art honourable and just, sire. 'Tis the snakes who are vile! Hissing in the grass...
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  MORELL-203.wav|He's not comfortable with the possibility that you'll claim the find, but he's lying about this even to himself.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  MORELL-319.wav|He hasn't been particularly forthcoming before. He may well still be hiding something. After he's left it's too late.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-88.wav|His smile, meant to convey total openness, is that of an experienced salesman.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-191.wav|He is trying to avoid lying to you outright in case you really have been to his apartment.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-401.wav|Degenerates? This man respects authority too much to see the truth inscribed upon thine own visage. Pretend thou art a paragon of virtue.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-416.wav|This man respects authority too much to see you for what you are. Pretend thou art a sober man!
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-529.wav|We're not detecting falsehoods, sire. He's gearing up to admit the truth.
wavs/Drama-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-278.wav|The man speaks in the artificial cadence of a professor, or someone who's been on too many radio shows.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-445.wav|She seems to be telling the truth, sire.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-784.wav|Pff... It's surely an act. Ask questions. Tough ones, preferably.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  MEDICINE CABINET-121.wav|It's not insincere. He's actually giving it thought.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-39.wav|It's all very organic, her mannerisms, her movements. If she's acting, she's quite gifted.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-419.wav|That's a strange thing to suggest. The laedy iseth faere and juste!
wavs/Drama-KIM SWITCH  DISCUSSING KLAASJE DOWNSTAIRS-7.wav|You would have caught it.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-399.wav|Well, he's definitely not lying, he wouldn't endanger this business like that.
wavs/Drama-JAM  TOMMY-75.wav|Mazut is an antiquated term for heavy fuel oils, this man has a barely suppressed performative streak. Or he just likes unusual words. Or both!
wavs/Drama-JAM  TOMMY-428.wav|It's easy to see he's telling the truth. He's kept his nose out of the dark stuff.
wavs/Drama-JAM  TOMMY-482.wav|He's not lying. He liked the end.
wavs/Drama-JAM  TOMMY-500.wav|We wouldn't say he's lying, sire.
wavs/Drama-JAM  TOMMY-504.wav|Again, not a lie as far as you can tell.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-160.wav|Look at him raise his bushy brows. That's a lie. He's empty.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-171.wav|You were right.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-911.wav|Even with the intensity he's putting in those words, and the fidgeting in his pocket, the kid is unconvincing.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-927.wav|Not in a million years does he believe Cuno is armed. Perhaps it's the best end he can hope for?
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-74.wav|He heard you. He just wants to hear you say it again. This is dramatic flare on his part... Right choice, we're in! Do it, sire!
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-254.wav|Lie! You have a witness.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-443.wav|The prints were his, you can see it in those eyes, he can't keep them from flickering, looking for something...
wavs/Drama-KIM SWITCH  DESERTER TACTICS-28.wav|Yes, sire! Make a production of this examination!
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-102.wav|He's setting it up for you...
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-356.wav|Safe and sound, sire. Surely you have not misplaced the witness.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-385.wav|There is more here, you can feel it. He was not outright lying but almost...
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-390.wav|There is more here, but you may not have the information to pry it loose from him...
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-451.wav|Be abstract here. A bit of drama.
wavs/Drama-SEAFORT  DESERTER ARREST-732.wav|No one would believe you without it.
wavs/Drama-GATES  SCAB LEADER-275.wav|Pretty okay, as far as lies go.
wavs/Drama-GATES  SCAB LEADER-288.wav|It just has to be said, that was not a convincing line.
wavs/Drama-GATES  SCAB LEADER-295.wav|Loincloth? Now, you see, that's not really what a scab would say is it? Better not to press the issue further, sire. He seems... tense.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MANANA-286.wav|Now you're in a mess. The time hath not arrived. Sorry.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MANANA-616.wav|He can't know that. Maybe you're just younger on the photo.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MANANA-623.wav|He's not lying, about not doing it himself.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MANANA-637.wav|He didn't do it. It's the truth.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MANANA-732.wav|He believes the Hardie boys could've done it.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-488.wav|Yes, it was probably nothing.
wavs/Drama-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-955.wav|He had nothing to do with it.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART ME-165.wav|Don't just jump to the folder. That's not smart, shows you're on the edge. Do some probing first.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-276.wav|Her entire character has shifted. This young woman is cold as ice.
wavs/Drama-KINEEMA  SERIAL NUMBER-135.wav|We're still glad you did it, my liege. This was good training. For when you need to lie to save your life maybe?
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-260.wav|Yes, you do.
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-300.wav|My liege! You know what this case calls for? A para-detective!
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-339.wav|Stop being such a fussy prude! You can't convince her without liessssss.
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-369.wav|Thy sweet tongue drips not with honey today... yet, try thou must!
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-377.wav|'Tis a poor craftsman who blames his tools!
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-466.wav|Attaboy.
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-468.wav|You know, maybe this time you should just be upfront with her?
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-509.wav|She recites it like it's a poem, or like she's playing a role she's grown tired of.
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-726.wav|For whatever reason she's lying to you about the fridge. Seems like you have to find your own way to the cellar.
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-776.wav|Do not act surprised. You know of these things, sire.
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-818.wav|Here we go!
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-829.wav|To hell with it, perchance you ought to just lie, sire?
wavs/Drama-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-850.wav|She so badly wants this to be over, she would have believed anything.
wavs/Drama-INVENTORY  WIRRAL MODULE-28.wav|And most importantly, never forget to rage-quit if the dice don't go your way!
wavs/Drama-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-587.wav|She doesn't believe you.
wavs/Drama-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-252.wav|Maybe twist the knife? Just in case. Make her more desperate.
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-522.wav|Test the waters here. Say that there's nothing to be worried about.
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-592.wav|She really believes that.
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-692.wav|Sire, she doesn't believe things will ever improve around here.
wavs/Drama-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-763.wav|The truth, sire.
wavs/Drama-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-722.wav|Lies, sire! She cannot but love you. She  has said so a hundred times.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-349.wav|Sire, the boy believes this to be true. He's giving you a last chance.
wavs/Drama-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-151.wav|He tries to keep his voice casual and businesslike, but it trembles ever so slightly.
wavs/Drama-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-162.wav|The kid is admitting falsehood, sire. He just doesn't know.
wavs/Drama-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-217.wav|It's for show, my liege. He knows you need more than this to bust this guy. Later, perhaps?
wavs/Drama-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-313.wav|It feels great.
wavs/Drama-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-366.wav|A blatant lie, sire. Yet he tells it with such conviction. We'd believe him, if we didn't know better.
wavs/Drama-JAM  PALEDRIVER-296.wav|Yeah... it's not her. Believe me.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-239.wav|You can almost hear the gears rattling, a change in set decorations.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-304.wav|It's a dry laugh. Mirthless. She's not even actually enjoying this. She only wants to hurt you.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-463.wav|This boy of twelve does not know anyone from Graad, sire. We suspect the boy himself might be this mystery 'Martin'.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO BODY-112.wav|He's trying to hide the fact that he doesn't know.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO BODY-190.wav|Curious, my liege. Why did Cuno feed you this information?
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO BODY-197.wav|Yes, pray pardon, sire! Better to let it be. I did not mean to make you paranoid.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO BODY-199.wav|Still, seems suspicious... He may have it in for that guy. Or you may be paranoid. That is also a possibility, sire.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO FRIDGE-77.wav|The Golden Mouth Man is a liar. He can't be trusted, sire. He only wants to humiliate you.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO SCENE-130.wav|He's hiding something.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO SCENE-137.wav|Of course, sire. Better not anger the Cuno with this silliness. We regret bringing it up. A thousand years of misfortune upon us for bringing it up!
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO SCENE-139.wav|But it is not hidden, is it, sire? You picked up on it. You should examine the pile of roofing material again.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-131.wav|He's meant everything he said before; but right now he not only means it, he is sincere.
wavs/Drama-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-170.wav|He speaks the truth, my liege.
wavs/Drama-APT  WCW MAIN-347.wav|Can't write a scene without knowing the actors. Ask more, get comfortable around her.
wavs/Drama-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-561.wav|What about that gremlin child from behind the Whirling-in-Ragssss?
wavs/alternative-0-Drama-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-561-0.wav|Of all the names stored in the rusty filing cabinet that is your hippocampus, the one you pull out is...
wavs/Drama-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-706.wav|A bullet deftly dodged, ssssire.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-835.wav|That's the truth.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-282.wav|Sire, the tale is true.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-319.wav|There's something odd here.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-361.wav|He may be lying, but he's good at it. No twitching, no rushing, no uncalled-for details.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-189.wav|Who could? It's getting harder and harder to perform one's part in this sordid play. All it takes is a nudge...
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-190.wav|He's working really, really hard to spin this.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-194.wav|He's working really, really hard to spin this, but it's not easy.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-420.wav|That's all he knows, that's all she's told him.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-745.wav|Say: "Five hundred Lears and I can't remember the first line!!!"
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-777.wav|No, no! He needs to say: "Five hundred Lears and I can't remember the first line!"
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART ME-103.wav|He got the name from the Census Bureau and everything else from your behaviour here in Martinaise.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-179.wav|He really doesn't know.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-183.wav|He really doesn't.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-482.wav|Oddly, it seems to be true.
wavs/Drama-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-495.wav|It's impossible to say if he's telling the truth, sire.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-268.wav|Surely it was nothing, sire. Just paranoia.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-271.wav|Of course, sire, of course.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-274.wav|Yes, think about the cute grandma, not the weird snow.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-278.wav|She feels interrogated now. It's hard to say if she's lying.
wavs/Drama-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-402.wav|There's a little meanness in that smile.
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  ELECTRONIC DOORBELL-234.wav|Is this some kind of joke?
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-821.wav|Nothing changes in her tone as she says that, as if it's just another piece of information to lay out for the world.
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-837.wav|She sounds almost mocking when she says that.
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-870.wav|It was too real to be just a prank. Either we're dealing with a professional actress, or...
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-901.wav|No falsehoods are present. She's a novelty dicemaker and doesn't have anything to hide. Ask what you need.
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-903.wav|She's heard of the murder, but did not see it, sire.
wavs/Drama-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-940.wav|That's all she has to say on the subject. She's been thorough and truthful as far as we can see.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  MORELL-436.wav|Self-deceit, sire.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  MORELL-653.wav|She acts chipper, but something's changed in her tone. A hidden worry.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-553.wav|We're detecting sincere contrition here, sire. He's not trying to flatter anyone.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-591.wav|This is all he knows.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-601.wav|'Tis true sire. This man simply did not know what he was getting caught up in.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-614.wav|Uncomfortable shifting around doesn't make him the killer, though. It's something else.
wavs/Drama-WESTCOAST  GARY-644.wav|An infant could see he's not telling the truth, but he's too scared to admit more wrongdoing.
wavs/Drama-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-293.wav|He's telling the truth. He hasn't seen anyone.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-806.wav|She doesn't seem to be lying, she's genuinely spooked by their disappearance.
wavs/Drama-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-843.wav|Yes! We demand she be punished for deceiving us. We demand her anxiety. We demand her fear.

wavs/Esprit de Corps-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-109.wav|The lieutenant doesn't like this. It may be less destructive to your working relationship to just come back alone later.
wavs/Esprit de Corps-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-275.wav|For heaven's sake, he thinks, this has gone too far. Don't make this any worse than it is, just get back to questioning the kid.

wavs/Esprit de Corps-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-751.wav|He fires a nod of solidarity in your direction, as if to say: take your time. It's okay.
wavs/Esprit de Corps-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-895.wav|Not just granite, tightly packed RCM sergeant material.
wavs/Esprit de Corps-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-950.wav|And he still isn't. People aren't afraid of good cops in the way Ruby was afraid of you, he thinks, then turns back to his men.

wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-183.wav|Crackling static... more static and yes, more of that sweet static. The violence of your words is obviously scaring her.
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-214.wav|Khm... Correction: Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Love.
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-242.wav|Yeah, I think she got it. Good job!
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-347.wav|Garbage!
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  STATION CALL-384.wav|Enough, officer. This begging is below your dignity.
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  STATION CALL-487.wav|DEFEND YOURSELF. Immediately. They're laughing at you.
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  SERIAL NUMBER-22.wav|There's a slightly weary, condescending note in her voice. She doesn't trust your professionalism following your rather tasteless come-ons.
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  SERIAL NUMBER-155.wav|A compliment from Lieutenant Kitsuragi! Not bad.
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  REPORTING THE CORPSE ON THE BOARDWALK-25.wav|So unprofessional of you... Pity!
wavs/Authority-KINEEMA  LAZARETH CALL-160.wav|There is no surprise in his voice. Only careless superiority.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-55.wav|Towering over her in your insignia, you make her feel safe.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-390.wav|Damn it, I was really hoping it would be a Cop World. Okay, well, let's see...
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-227.wav|To redeem yourself before the hoods of Law. Now start asking questions, like a real law enforcement official.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-336.wav|There's a hint of defensiveness to her retort, but also confidence. She seems to sit up a little straighter in her chair.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-633.wav|Damn it, I was really hoping it would be a Cop World. Okay, well, let's see...
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-724.wav|And when a police officer asks, you must answer.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-157.wav|Men of duty. Dark duty.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-172.wav|Overpriced mercenaries putting down some rabid dogs. Someone's gotta do it, right?
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-173.wav|In all truth, violence offers no answer... It's only the last available resort when all mediation fails. And here, all did fail.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-174.wav|Martyrs of the Nation, the ardent knights. The few who had the guts to do this.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-178.wav|Murderers. Twisted by orders. Young boys forced into killing.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  EXECUTIONS VISCAL-181.wav|Soldiers... people in a bad spot they probably did not choose, ordered to commit acts they wanted no part of.
wavs/Authority-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-214.wav|Slap the cuffs on her!
wavs/Authority-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-744.wav|What is this insolence? She misunderstood.
wavs/Authority-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-240.wav|What is that patronizing tone? You're one of the suzerain's trusted administrators! You may need to put the lieutenant in his place...
wavs/Authority-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-241.wav|Now's your chance. Show the lieutenant what happens when he patronizes you.
wavs/Authority-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-245.wav|What is that patronizing tone? Someone needs to put the lieutenant in his place.
wavs/Authority-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-57.wav|Makes sense. Friends are nice on Sunday. You don't have to work, you can just spend time with pals, watching rugby and drinking beer.
wavs/Authority-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-68.wav|Ask him again.
wavs/Authority-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-20.wav|She's refusing to adopt the demeanour of a cornered animal. A leader with no one to lead, she still wants to retain some control of the situation.
wavs/Authority-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-39.wav|So she says she didn't do it, and she doesn't trust you. Is it you specifically or the Citizens Militia that she distrusts?
wavs/Authority-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-210.wav|Even now, Kim is a paragon of professionalism: he's trying to make a clean cut of telling her she was betrayed.
wavs/Authority-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-554.wav|He couldn't take it like you. It irks him, then he gets over it.
wavs/Authority-LAIR ORB  beware shivers-23.wav|He trusts your gut feeling on this.
wavs/Authority-LAIR ORB  shot viscal-46.wav|The lieutenant's voice betrays a slight disappointment, which he glosses over by reasserting control.
wavs/Authority-INVENTORY  RUBY'S JOURNAL-138.wav|Staff issues, always tough on the leadership. You smell traces of betrayal.
wavs/Authority-INVENTORY  RUBY'S JOURNAL-157.wav|The call was a courtesy. He must have held her in high regard to personally tell her he knew about her plan to run drugs for the competition.
wavs/Authority-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-182.wav|She's proud of her organizational abilities even now, and trying to raise that pride as a bulwark against the desperation.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-73.wav|No one? There's something about her... She's definitely not a 'no one'.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-374.wav|She speaks with the authority of a leader. Hers is the final word around here.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-450.wav|She acknowledges you as her equal.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-456.wav|She's got a couple of ranks herself. Honoured chief and so on.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-515.wav|More like a slave to any master who tosses a bone your way.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-710.wav|The virtue you exhibit in even the most difficult of moral dilemmas, speaks of the purest of heart and soul. Soon it will be time for another Arch.

wavs/Authority-ICE  ANDRE TENT CONTENT-255.wav|A respectful nod. You proved something here.
wavs/Authority-ICE  EGGHEAD-722.wav|Your cop training did not prepare you for this. What to do?
wavs/Authority-ICE  KIM RACISM FINAL TALK-110.wav|The sentence has been passed.

wavs/Authority-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-347.wav|Who's the one in charge? You are!
wavs/Authority-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-447.wav|You have more control than they do, the agreement should reflect that. You should push for 60%.
wavs/Authority-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-469.wav|There's always your backup outside... stay firm. You've got the upper hand.
wavs/Authority-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-804.wav|This is it. Judgement time!
wavs/Authority-ICE  ACELE-56.wav|Odd. Something about the way she says it makes you think she's not bothered by any of the cop-show questioning.
wavs/Authority-ICE  ACELE-189.wav|Something about the way she says it makes you think she's not bothered by any of the cop-show questioning.
wavs/Authority-ICE  ACELE-608.wav|What did she just say? That's not how a civilian is supposed to address an officer of the law.
wavs/Authority-ICE  ACELE-693.wav|You're saying it really loud, but it's not coming out right. Maybe add more indignation?
wavs/Authority-ICE  ACELE-768.wav|Your eyes are fixed on her as everything gets very still, dangerously so...
wavs/Authority-ICE  ACELE-769.wav|Make her meet your eyes.

wavs/Authority-LANDS END  NETPICKER-78.wav|Don't be fooled. He's watching you to make sure you don't act unprofessionally.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  GASTON-21.wav|His tone lacks its usual intensity, like he doesn't feel he has the right to speak on the matter.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  RENE WC HERO STORY-93.wav|His tone is like that of a drill-sergeant addressing new recruits.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  RENE WC HERO STORY-111.wav|For a moment frozen in time this old soldier is your superior officer, inspiring you to be a better man. It feels good. Comforting.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-131.wav|His tone leaves no room for arguments. Giving orders is a second skin to the old carabineer.

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GORACY KUBEK-97.wav|Listen to him. This is a man who clearly knows about bodies and fridges, and bodies fitting into fridges.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GORACY KUBEK-115.wav|It doesn't matter, you're a police officer, you can do anything you want.

wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  POSSE-891.wav|Leadership, now.

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-116.wav|A glib remark. Don't let it stand, assert yourself.

wavs/Authority-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-162.wav|This seems serious...

wavs/Authority-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-383.wav|It is. It is well within her authority. It's been clear for some time that this woman is more than she lets on.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-244.wav|Trying to recruit him is like trying to make a pet out of fire. This kid recognizes only one authority, his own.
wavs/Authority-JAM ORB  fuckoffafterthought-7.wav|That means you should do it whenever you feel like someone's disrespecting your authority.
wavs/Authority-JAM  PALEDRIVER-186.wav|This line of questioning is going nowhere! Try harder!

wavs/Authority-JAM  RACIST-607.wav|He's been expecting this. He's really puffed himself up.
wavs/Authority-JAM  RACIST-635.wav|Now it's not a big deal for him anymore. This is how he saves face.

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-228.wav|He wasn't calling the shots that night... or any night. If anything, he was used as a tool, for carrying, or clean-up.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-239.wav|That's it. There's some kind of power issue they don't want to admit, and the missing Hardie is involved.

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-382.wav|Titus lets the others clear out the details, so he doesn't get his hands muddy with explaining too much.

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-99.wav|There's a bit of truth in there for Titus to react so brashly. He does not like his authority questioned.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-502.wav|Titus doesn't reply, probably a good sign.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-520.wav|Also, it has to be said, this man would make a good RCM sergeant. Or maybe even lieutenant. Just don't let him anywhere near women.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-612.wav|He knows Eugene is more lieutenant material than he is.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-641.wav|He knows it's something. He's just not ready to say you knew more about Ruby than he does, yet.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-805.wav|This is the only opinion he cares for.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-875.wav|It's not an actual question.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-79.wav|Like a general over his maps, he plots his moves. Judging by the way he's licking his chops, it's going to be a good one.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-230.wav|Questions will show him who's boss.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-240.wav|He's trying to throw you off your game, thinking you don't know your name, but you do! So the joke's on him, ha ha!
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-410.wav|Throwing rocks at motor carriages isn't really the same thing as running a drug lab, is it?
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-662.wav|Is he?
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-107.wav|He really takes great pride in being in Evrart's good graces.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-265.wav|You would look nice as a statue...
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-267.wav|You would look nice as a statue...
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART UNION-281.wav|And they're all well motivated. At least the ones you've seen.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-67.wav|He wants to send a message: "Even the police are working for me."
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-488.wav|That's all he's going to say on this subject.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-500.wav|Don't give him the pleasure.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-509.wav|Kingsman? Yes! Please, let's be that.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-514.wav|You can now go and tell Titus about this. See what he has to say.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-495.wav|Stop embarrassing yourself. Pop a magnesium and calm down.
wavs/Authority-CONTAINERYARD  CLOAK JUMP-66.wav|We'll take care of that body too. We'll take care of all of it!
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-17.wav|Even if she didn't write it, she should CLEAN IT.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-199.wav|Nothing to see here. Just a regular law official reacting to every day stimuli. Nothing noteworthy here.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-249.wav|She's probably not gonna do it.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-181.wav|Was it a good idea on the lieutenant's part to get into this? Don't even answer that, just leave. You can always come back later, on your own terms.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-316.wav|What is wrong with you? Now you're just empowering these punks.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-319.wav|That's right! Way to put them in the little boys corner!
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  PISSFLAUBERT AND FTW-433.wav|What would these guys have to offer to any organization?
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  CENTRAL FURNACE-53.wav|These three stripes give you strength in this dangerous realm. It would be foolish to remove them.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  CENTRAL FURNACE-62.wav|What a proud warrior! This is how the hunted becomes the hunter in this dark dangerous place.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  ICE BEAR FRIDGE-166.wav|He means it. He doesn't want to be the Ice Bear Cop.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  HIDDEN WEAPONS CACHE-48.wav|Take it! You're a police officer. Police officers carry guns.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  FREQUENCY FIREPLACE-46.wav|The leader of a massive on-air game built by these people.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-67.wav|That's right. You'll make your own luck.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-612.wav|She's right, when was the last time? You should get an un-androgynous crew cut.
wavs/Authority-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-839.wav|She's right, showing up to work on time is important.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-147.wav|It might be because you have the higher rank.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-151.wav|A patrol officer is the lowest rank in the RCM, below lieutenant and sergeant.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-155.wav|As Lieutenant Kitsuragi explained, a patrol officer is the lowest rank in the RCM, below lieutenant and sergeant.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-269.wav|Hear that? He wants you to say things. Say one!
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-113.wav|Again? Seriously?
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-214.wav|Before it's too late, please.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  MORELL-318.wav|This is a slippery one, he may respect the law, but mostly wants to pass under the radar. You won't get a chance to talk after you walk out of here.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  MORELL-588.wav|The first man to break formation is always a blow to leadership. This is bigger than he lets on.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  MORELL-634.wav|There won't be a next season. Not for this. Find the phasmid or admit defeat, people.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  GARY-650.wav|This man is truly sorry for underestimating the honour and military might of the Seolite man.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  GARY-702.wav|See? He's being evasive. Shake him up, show him who's boss.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  GARY-713.wav|I'm satisfied. Are you satisfied? Because I am.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  MORELL CRYPTIDS-121.wav|He does not want to make it feel like you knowing it is some big deal.
wavs/Authority-WESTCOAST  MORELL CRYPTIDS-144.wav|Here is a man who has had more than his fair share of heated arguments, and would, surprising as it may seem, prefer not to have any more.
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-216.wav|Here's a former junkie. I can recognize one when I see it.
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  LADDER-12.wav|He is restraining himself from using a parental tone with you right now.
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-267.wav|It's a shame. Recognition from an actual police officer would probably mean a lot to her. Too bad she'll never know...
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-275.wav|That... was the most honourable thing anyone has ever done.
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS RED CHECK-304.wav|That... was the most honourable thing anyone has ever done, Harry.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-86.wav|OH YEAH, FEEL THE POWER.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-112.wav|Coach Physical Instrument is overdoing it, even by my standards. Say something else first.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-929.wav|Technically, possession of narcotics is legal in Revachol. But you should still reprimand her.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F2  MEDICINE CABINET-152.wav|Yes, take it... and then dispose of it! This den of narcomania cannot be allowed stand!
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-522.wav|He's used to knowing who to trust. This makes him uncomfortable.

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-497.wav|Yes, you. He's talking about you, you grovelling sycophant.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-163.wav|There is no talking him out of this, and no, the incident has not had a good effect on his opinion of you either.
wavs/Authority-KIM SWITCH  KLAASJE REACTION-16.wav|He's not leaving you a lot of room to back off from this.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3 ORB  narcomania afterthought-2.wav|You made the right call there. It feels good. Pure.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3 ORB  narcomania afterthought-45.wav|Your words sound hollow and unconvincing. You're a weakling, a servant to the dark arts of narcomania.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3 ORB  narcomania afterthought-49.wav|You say the words loudly to yourself. That makes them very convincing. The world applauds you, you are finally on the holy warpath against narcomania!
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-49.wav|Is she implying the Hardie boys are THE LAW?!
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-270.wav|This Ruby, in her phrasing, is entrusted with great power. She trusts her. So do the others.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-757.wav|Failure to aid a police investigation.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1198.wav|Don't arrest her. Push her a bit more but then let her off. That Ruby theory was solid. (And she's beautiful.)

wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-148.wav|For a moment, the Cafeteria Manager fidgets under the lieutenant's gaze. Then he gives in.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-152.wav|For a moment, the man fidgets under the lieutenant's gaze. Then he gives in.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-370.wav|The words leave your mouth as if walking up the stairs, everything is going fine until you reach the end and take one step too many:
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-379.wav|That's cop for: "I haven't offered to pay because I don't have any money either."
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-463.wav|The words nail the Cafeteria Manager to his place. Unmoving he stares down at the counter with his cheeks reddish.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-467.wav|The words nail the man to his place. Unmoving, he stares down at the counter with his cheeks reddish.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-484.wav|From the bottom of your blue soul, a term emerges:
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-638.wav|He has no respect for you personally, but this man sees himself as a law-abiding citizen, and you a representative of that law.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-174.wav|He hates the Union, but grudgingly recognizes its power over him, so he's directing his frustration at you instead. Retaliate!
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-226.wav|He shrinks back a bit under the lieutenant's severe gaze.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-789.wav|He thinks it weak to renege on the courtesy he already decided to pay you. Moral superiority is important to him.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1023.wav|There is an acrimonious note. It's clear he's doing the real work around here.
wavs/Authority-JAM  TOMMY-372.wav|Time to arrest him!
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-122.wav|That was not the right move. You should have pushed on.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-239.wav|Forget about that for a moment. You need to address that remark first.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-240.wav|You need to address that remark.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  THE DESERTER-546.wav|A terrible shame, still within him. The lobes of his ears are red with it, the shame and smallness of what he became.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-60.wav|He's letting his pride get in the way.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-176.wav|About now he is ready to believe in anything.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-293.wav|Something cracks in the lieutenant. He's letting his pride get in the way.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-592.wav|ON THE SCENE
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-707.wav|Nothing but you, a detective of the RCM, standing there with your mouth agape.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  INSULINDIAN PHASMID-918.wav|He's truly satisfied with your performance in Death Island right now.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-133.wav|Now. Push him now.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-589.wav|You don't shush me! He could say he was taking the fall for someone. Or disoriented. A confession is useless without a motive, don't mess this up.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  DESERTER MURDER-602.wav|He could say he was taking the fall for someone. It's useless in court without a motive, go be a cop now, don't mess it up...
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  DESERTER REASONING-41.wav|To punish her.
wavs/Authority-SEAFORT  DESERTER BONUS-517.wav|Dumbo, do something, you can't zone out now, this isn't doodle-loo dance time.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  KORTENAER-52.wav|"No," you scream: "BEHIND YOU!" from your bloody lips. Your eyes are full of fear.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  KORTENAER-245.wav|"NO," you say, and hand out your firearm to him. Your hand trembles and your eyes are full of fear.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  KORTENAER-391.wav|He is facing overwhelmingly superior firepower, and he knows it.
wavs/Authority-TRIBUNAL  THIRD GUY-18.wav|He is not used to commanding, or leading. He feels uncomfortable. He'd rather shoot to kill...
wavs/Authority-GATES  SCAB LEADER-379.wav|He's under orders. And orders, are orders.
wavs/Authority-GATES  SCAB LEADER-396.wav|He seems to be following his orders well enough for now, but beneath it all there is a boiling rage. And a dangerous carelessness.
wavs/Authority-GATES  MANANA-294.wav|You feel like you earned a significant amount of honour points today.
wavs/Authority-GATES  MANANA-448.wav|Is he actually comparing you, an officer of the law, to some neighbourhood vigilantes?!
wavs/Authority-GATES  MANANA-699.wav|Not you, you would like to say... But then there's that weasel door.
wavs/Authority-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-33.wav|Don't say anything, size him up first.
wavs/Authority-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-172.wav|That would mean you're openly showing the people that you're taking the Union's side.
wavs/Authority-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-250.wav|Show him the ham still got it!
wavs/Authority-GATES  MEASUREHEAD-613.wav|The sage will not budge on this.
wavs/Authority-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-884.wav|Quit while you're ahead? Or... no?
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  THE GARDENER MAIN-282.wav|A very minor victory.
wavs/Authority-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-463.wav|Well... The rest of that nancy stuff was really just there to make the gun thing more appealing. But it might work anyway.
wavs/Authority-BOARDWALK  TRANT HEIDELSTAM INTRO-294.wav|He's not gonna give you money, what are you doing? Clearly you were just profiling.
wavs/Authority-PLAZA  KORTENAER-533.wav|He doesn't want to. But he must.
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-7.wav|Yes. Guess what's yours?
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-8.wav|Guess.
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-16.wav|Yes. Sorry Cop. The cop who's sorriest. Let's make it official, then, shall we?
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-22.wav|Oh, you know. Apocalypse, Superstellar, The Advanced Interesting Cop. Liquid Shadow Cop. But you're too sorry to say those things, so, here we go?
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-28.wav|Yes-yes, impotent rage and lamentation. Let's wrap it up?
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-32.wav|No, you don't. C'mon. You'll be back to saying sorry in two minutes. Stop wasting time and begin The Repentance.
wavs/Suggestion-THOUGHT  SORRY COP-41.wav|That is only a ludicrous daydream. Guess again. You're the...
wavs/Suggestion-INITIATION  SPEED HABIT-39.wav|Time for a little truth. Tell the lieutenant you did some, clear the air.
wavs/Suggestion-HQ  WASHBASIN-23.wav|Your face, such as it is. A regular human face. Sans expression.
wavs/Suggestion-HQ  WASHBASIN-27.wav|The beardless nature of your cheeks makes The Expression seem even more like a terrifying grimace.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  MAINFRAME-368.wav|You should ask her for a hint.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  TIAGO-349.wav|Could it be that he just doesn't want to discuss a police raid with another police officer?
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  TIAGO-488.wav|No need to overdo it. He won't mind sharing it with you.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-501.wav|Just tell her about Egg Head's defence speech.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-505.wav|Easy, when her research is done, she can move out.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-556.wav|Hey, what makes the world go round?
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-811.wav|Hey, maybe if you were to find out more about her previous company, Fortress Accident, you'd have something new to say...
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-813.wav|Wait! she doesn't want to share the space with them, help her finish the research, then she won't have to! Offer to help.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-814.wav|Wait! She doesn't want to share the space with them, you can help her finish the research, then she won't have to! Offer to help.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-1019.wav|Maybe the speedfreaks can help you with this? Go talk with Andre.
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-1047.wav|Hey, hey, what are you doing, laying everything out like that?!
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH  SOONA-1092.wav|Brilliant negotiating there, detective, as always!
wavs/Suggestion-CHURCH ORB  cone of silence-56.wav|He's trying to act dismissive, but at this particular moment, he's more open than usual to the idea of paranatural phenomena.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  ANNETTE-416.wav|She actually is impressed, this is more like a defensive reflex.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  ANNETTE-511.wav|Because you know each other. She's been talking to you so openly because you've talked before.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  ANNETTE-695.wav|You have absolutely no idea. Familiar how? You must have forgotten something you heard again.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  WORKING CLASS WOMAN-279.wav|She genuinely wants you to, now. Don't make her ask.
wavs/Suggestion-COAST ORB  roadsidethought-20.wav|His boyfriend is on his way home. He brings tins of meat and vegetables with him. Their pockets are heavier with money; but only slightly.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  ABIGAIL-75.wav|Abigail is his wife or girlfriend. Chances are, she's gone. Calling her wouldn't make it any better or worse.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  ROSEMARY-233.wav|Conversation might bring a discount, no?
wavs/Suggestion-KINEEMA ORB  torque talk-177.wav|Whatever you do, don't make fun of the lieutenant for explaining this to you.
wavs/Suggestion-KINEEMA  SYLVIE-291.wav|You think you hear a sliver of accusation in her words.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  COUPRIS KINEEMA-359.wav|A vanity he wouldn't mind.
wavs/Suggestion-KINEEMA  STATION CALL-383.wav|Who cares what this Vicquemare said, pull on their heart strings!
wavs/Suggestion-KINEEMA  STATION CALL-505.wav|SAY MY NAME BITCH! What are you doing, you sound way too aggressive.
wavs/Suggestion-KINEEMA  LAZARETH CALL-42.wav|Was that a snarl or a suppressed groan? No love for you here.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-189.wav|She won't judge you, no matter what you say.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-216.wav|Your deportment remains dignified, as you shed a single, manly tear.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA INTRO-277.wav|In another time and place, she might have flirted back. But that ship sailed long ago.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-58.wav|The lieutenant doesn't want to agitate the woman.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-248.wav|The lady is distressed. Perhaps something more up-beat might cheer her up?
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-423.wav|An acorn is not the same as the tree. That requires time, diligence, and care...
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-730.wav|That I'm a queen. An extraordinary witness to grace.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA MAIN-733.wav|All qualities these two seem to share in abundance.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-17.wav|There's really no point in manipulating anyone. She'd be only too pleased to tell you about her work. Go on and ask!
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-27.wav|Nope, you don't have any new winning tactics to get the woman to spill the beans about cryptids.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-70.wav|You're an enthusiastic idiot. But you're still an idiot.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-100.wav|There's really no point in manipulating anyone. You're chummy. Just go on and ask!
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-253.wav|Oh no, she's making excuses. You're not interesting enough to talk cryptids with.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  LENA CRYPTIDS CHECK-350.wav|This lady really should be a teacher. She's really good at the explaining things thing.
wavs/Suggestion-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-44.wav|She has fine-tuned her voice to find the most welcoming approach for attracting new customers. It doesn't work.
wavs/Suggestion-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-753.wav|Take it easy. You've broken her resistance. Pushing her further will gain nothing.
wavs/Suggestion-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-759.wav|This definitely softened her up.
wavs/Suggestion-BOOKSTORE  PLAISANCE-882.wav|Maybe it's best to tell her the truth after all. Here we go...
wavs/Suggestion-BOOKSTORE  BIOGRAPHIES-36.wav|She understands she has erred against the customer and immediately corrects course.
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-28.wav|What is detective work if not an elaborate game? You need logical inference, attention to detail, the ability to analyse your opponents' motives...
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-339.wav|Have you tried... goading him?
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-345.wav|At this point, plain badgering may be your best bet.
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  SUZERAINTY GAME-414.wav|See? He's doing the hard work himself. All he needed was a little nudge...
wavs/Suggestion-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-92.wav|This isn't the place or time for questions: Who knows who might be watching from the distance, hidden behind the curtains.
wavs/Suggestion-BACKYARD  SMOKER ON THE BALCONY-144.wav|It's a sign!
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-53.wav|The voice coming through the whirlwind of pain is not malicious. She doesn't want to hurt you, but she has to.
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-267.wav|She's been holed up in here for a while with no one to talk to. Keep her talking, and you just might get an opportunity to break loose.
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-391.wav|Just keep her talking and you'll get through this.
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  INSTIGATOR-545.wav|She's not going to change her mind that easily. She still perceives you as a threat.
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-201.wav|That didn't go super well. You've gotta lay something better on her.
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  INSTIGATOR CASE-272.wav|More. More questions before doing anything.
wavs/Suggestion-LAIR  DRAINAGE PIPE-24.wav|The lieutenant's face lights up. He doesn't usually notice these little things.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-333.wav|Logic and reason won't work on this old bat. Better go for shameless emotional manipulation. What's a grandmother's deepest vulnerability?
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-391.wav|Like ocean waves shaping the coastline, you will wear her down. Pebble by pebble. Just be persistent.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-394.wav|Maybe just look at her with big pleading eyes?
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-395.wav|It's okay. She's emotional right now. Keep at it, wear her out.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-468.wav|You've got her. Now just reel 'er in.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-471.wav|Wait, Let her come to it herself.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-575.wav|Ask her about lodgings...
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-618.wav|This Ruby is an old-lady whisperer. She knows how to work the village elder, unlike you.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-761.wav|Damn, you almost had it. What was this, a pang of conscience?
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  WASHERWOMAN-764.wav|She wanted to talk to her, as they usually do. But she was brooding.
wavs/Suggestion-ICE  ANDRE-521.wav|You should go with the flow. Join in on the experience.
wavs/Suggestion-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-163.wav|Did that just cheer him up a bit? Could be... It feels like the lieutenant cracked a little smile there.
wavs/Suggestion-ICE  ANDRE WHITE CHECKS-330.wav|The optimal way to go about this would be indifference. It begins by you telling him you don't care about any of this.
wavs/Suggestion-ICE  ACELE-665.wav|Something changes between you two. She looks at you differently now, as an equal. A fellow human being.
wavs/Suggestion-ICE  ACELE-669.wav|She means your little talk before, after your breakdown. It's all right, she means to say. You returned the favour.
wavs/Suggestion-LANDS END  NETPICKER-188.wav|Not terribly impressed, not surprised either.
wavs/Suggestion-LANDS END  NETPICKER-245.wav|This is as far as it goes with her. You'd need to put a year between you and your last drink for anything more.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  RENE-228.wav|Judging by his attitude, probably the second one.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  RENE-315.wav|You stirred up some bad memories there.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  GASTON SANDWICH WC-109.wav|Whatever you're selling there, he's buying it. In bulk.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  RENE PETANQUE-116.wav|Just talk. It'll smooth things over. Old people like attention.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  RIVER CRATER-95.wav|He finds your lack of historic knowledge troubling. A sign of mental deterioration in the proceeding generations.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GORACY KUBEK-116.wav|You can always talk your way out if things go sour.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE-135.wav|No, no, no! You've sensitivity tested this!
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE-275.wav|It's true. You have a problem.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE-816.wav|He's right. Don't start guessing. Now's not a good time.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-438.wav|This isn't going to change a lot of minds, Harry.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-680.wav|They're not going to consider more than one piece of evidence, choose wisely.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-753.wav|Move on. Don't gloat.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 2-883.wav|You're doing good here. Perhaps only for a moment, but still...
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-25.wav|They're leaving. They're all turning away from you.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-310.wav|He's anything but a loser. Although he would like to be seen as one. It's cooler that way.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  POSSE 3-597.wav|She is going to be over the moon.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1 ORB  play pinball-53.wav|He also really doesn't want to talk about it.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA ORB  spirit bomb ready-149.wav|You're too likable to die. Don't worry.
wavs/Suggestion-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-333.wav|A form of communication where words have failed?
wavs/Suggestion-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-587.wav|Stop making her angry! She won't start loving you again if you call her a war criminal. Seriously.
wavs/Suggestion-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-627.wav|This was not about failure or success. This was always going to be horror. I should not have suggested it, and you should not have listened to me.
wavs/Suggestion-DREAM SEAFORT  DOLORES DEI-643.wav|Brother, you should put me in front of a firing squad. I have no words for how I failed you.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F2  KLAASJE 1-247.wav|The words have already left your mouth...
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-95.wav|Maybe there was a physically impressive strongman in their midst. Someone who wanted to impress their peers.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-130.wav|The lieutenant clearly appreciates the chance to clear up the drummer issue himself.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  FOOTPRINTS VISCAL-343.wav|Maybe the carrier wanted to impress his peers... demonstrate his physical might?
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  PHOTO OF TATTOOS-26.wav|Someone close to the victim might know.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  HANGED MAN AUTOPSY-477.wav|Thank you for lightening his mood. It's hard down there.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  HANGED MAN-166.wav|What was that about the Constabulatory before? You need to push some buttons if you want to recruit the lieutenant in a conspiracy.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  HANGED MAN-222.wav|Oops. Well, no one said it would work. Back to detecting now.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  HANGED MAN-524.wav|This is the first time he openly acknowledges the kids' existence.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  HANGED MAN-545.wav|There are crows feet in his eyes, he's laughing silently.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  HANGED MAN BULLET-64.wav|Her voice is absolutely sizzling with excitement.
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  LEDGER OF FAILURE-835.wav|A tool for manipulation. Give the lowest amount and people will be ingratiated to you.
wavs/Suggestion-INVENTORY  BADGE-175.wav|Good choice. A newer photo would look... different.
wavs/Suggestion-PAWNSHOP  ROY-87.wav|He's trying to ingratiate himself with you by anticipating your questions. He knows he shouldn't have sold the gun.
wavs/Suggestion-PAWNSHOP  ROY-180.wav|It's almost like he's worried for you.
wavs/Suggestion-PAWNSHOP  ROY-233.wav|Just explain why you need this so much. He's bound to understand.
wavs/Suggestion-PAWNSHOP  TABLE OF KNICKKNACKS-59.wav|That was a very smooth salesman's grin that almost comes off as earnest. You should learn from him.
wavs/Suggestion-PAWNSHOP  SHELF OF BOOMBOXES-49.wav|Just don't ask him for the smallest amount. You'll insult him. The others will work.
wavs/Suggestion-PAWNSHOP  SHELF OF BOOMBOXES-76.wav|What did I say? And what did you do? Damn it, man. You're buying it for twelve now, I guess.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-172.wav|The graciousness of her response makes you feel glad you didn't hassle her about her papers for no reason.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-508.wav|She enjoys talking about the company. It would not hurt to inquire more.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-673.wav|She's a negotiator. Just float a favour at her. Insinuate.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-686.wav|You're in, but expect her to drive a hard bargain.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-692.wav|You're doing it! Despite your own best efforts you're still getting in, somehow...
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-759.wav|It sounds like she tried looking into it herself. But she's clearly not the type your typical lorryman would confide in.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-763.wav|It sounds like she tried looking into it herself, though she's clearly not the type your typical lorryman would confide in.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1349.wav|With your help, hopefully, says her warm tone.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE INTRO-1515.wav|She means: you know her closer now, in some way you know her soul a bit.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE LYNCHING AND TATTOOS-16.wav|It only lasts for the briefest instance but you catch a look of disappointment in her eye. Anger even.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  CINDY-305.wav|She's grown frustrated with her work and welcomes the opportunity to challenge authority in other ways.
wavs/Suggestion-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-188.wav|There is curiosity there that goes unnoticed. The lieutenant takes a step back, absent-mindedly.
wavs/Suggestion-JOYCE  REALITY TIMES-352.wav|A counterargument, but still, your historic mass-murderer fantasies have only endeared you to this person.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-395.wav|Forgive her.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-597.wav|But... she wants to tell you.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE REALITY HUB-981.wav|Everyone wants to talk about themselves. She will, in time.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-218.wav|Hear that, hero? Feels good, doesn't it? You should relay confidential information more often.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-776.wav|Sounds like she'll solicit your help with something, when she gets the chance.
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-868.wav|Curiosity for the Union burns brighter in her than curiosity for the case...
wavs/Suggestion-PIER  JOYCE ON EVRART-915.wav|She's sentimental all right. You don't know enough about her to find out why exactly. She will keep her secrets for now.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F2  CUNO WAKEUP-317.wav|He's genuinely impressed, but that's mostly to do with how scientific that percentage sounded.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-243.wav|He didn't like him, that only makes it worse.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  TITUS ALAIN AND EUGENE-245.wav|Even after all that hell he's still bitter about her?
wavs/Suggestion-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-156.wav|Sounds like the kid has a soft spot for Lilienne.
wavs/Suggestion-PARTY  CUNO MAIN-183.wav|Good one, Cuno. It doesn't have to hold in court. Just establish a line of sight and he'll do the rest himself.
wavs/Suggestion-KIM SWITCH  RACIST KITSURAGI-26.wav|Well, now you've done it. Let's see if you can talk your way out of this one.
wavs/Suggestion-JAM  HUMANITARIAN AID-197.wav|As if you've committed some faux pas.
wavs/Suggestion-JAM  PALEDRIVER-437.wav|This man's got a hold over her. Even fifty years later, you can feel it...
wavs/Suggestion-JAM  PALEDRIVER-444.wav|She clearly doesn't think she's a 'lady'. Don't repeat it.
wavs/Suggestion-JAM  RACIST-277.wav|There's your in. Take his side in this particular fight.
wavs/Suggestion-JAM  RACIST-484.wav|Damn. It didn't work. You should have signalled you're a nationalist before.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-123.wav|She's making a joke. Her voice softens.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-484.wav|Ask her about the cool sword, helps to break the ice.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-505.wav|Sounds like she'd prefer her men to be less 'real'.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-507.wav|Not bad.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-547.wav|Yeah, maybe steer clear of the things reminding her of the 'floater' she used to be married to. Just saying.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-611.wav|You think she really needs more of that after her man died at sea?
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-612.wav|Get the drink ON. It would be unimaginable for a human female to have sex with a man without Al-Gul as the master of ceremonies to guide them.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-641.wav|It's okay, she just hasn't figured out how these things work between the sexes. Keep at it. She'll come around.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-647.wav|What if I told you... it is actually possible to go on a date sober?
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-674.wav|You were good. Why did you have to get so creepy all of the sudden? Now it's just questions again.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  NETPICKER-687.wav|Having the lieutenant along is a fail-safe measure against any possible funny-business.
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  LITTLE LILY-71.wav|You might be able to get on Garte's good side if you make up for the skua you broke?
wavs/Suggestion-VILLAGE  LITTLE LILY-83.wav|You might be able to get on Garte's good side if you replace the broken skua you almost certainly broke?
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO-272.wav|You should thank him.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO-298.wav|Cuno appreciates you recognizing him as the sovereign of Jamrock, though... North Jamrock, that is.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-278.wav|He gets it, you lost it. Just don't dig the hole any deeper.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO WHO IS CUNO-325.wav|He gets it. You lost. Now walk away with what remains of your dignity.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO BEFRIEND WC-199.wav|Cuno? Cunoesse? Two of a kind.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO LOCUSTS-133.wav|So that's what this is about.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO SPEED-14.wav|You need to befriend him first.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO SPEED-49.wav|You won't sweet-talk your way around this man. Good thing this psycho drug-boss is strictly optional.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO SPEED-195.wav|It's not hard to see at all. You hand out drugs to kids, the lieutenant's faith in your judgement will diminish significantly.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO SPEED-196.wav|It's quite imaginable. You start handing drugs out to kids, the lieutenant's faith in your judgement will diminish significantly.
wavs/Suggestion-YARD  CUNO SPEED-210.wav|None that you can see.
wavs/Suggestion-APT  WCW MAIN-351.wav|Definitely no small talk, this isn't the time or place.
wavs/Suggestion-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-229.wav|The tone somehow suggests to you that you're starting to become a little sponsored by him as well.
wavs/Suggestion-APT  TOMAS THE SPONSOR-243.wav|No, first ask an innocuous personal question to get the interview off on the right foot.
wavs/Suggestion-APT  EMPTY ROOM DOOR-41.wav|There's no sweet-talking your way in there. Be official.
wavs/Suggestion-APT  REAL ESTATE AGENT-45.wav|Be friendly.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING  KIM MAIN-760.wav|He's actually glad it's addressed now.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-138.wav|These guys are so macho they're ready to confess to first-degree murder. Ask if it was them.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-214.wav|There's laughter in the room. Try not to kill yourself this time.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-371.wav|Now watch the other guys fuck it up by falling out of line.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE-405.wav|Someone has to rush in to break the tension. The second in command.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-149.wav|There was a speck of truth in there for him. You accidentally touched something.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-263.wav|This is where he tries to sow discord between you two, because he knows the company is responsible for bringing the mercenaries into town.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-298.wav|It's true. She was the only thing holding him back.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-504.wav|Rent-a-cop? So that's what this is about. He doesn't see you as his equals.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE TELLS YOU ABOUT LYNCHING-512.wav|Rent-a-cop? So that's what this is about. He doesn't see you as his equal.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-42.wav|Now watch the other guys fuck it up by falling out of line.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-47.wav|... use it to take a dig at his friend. Flood gates open.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-55.wav|Too late, you already got a pretty good picture of these guys. You can use this.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-84.wav|You could take another look at the tracks in the yard, see if they fit with the characters here, it could be incriminating.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-113.wav|This one knows how to keep things going. He's a hothead, but not one to be taken lightly. The last one is a bit of a black sheep...
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE SCAN THE ROOM-119.wav|This person Glen wants to hire, he really respects her.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-21.wav|Sounds like he wanted it to change her mind about the hanged man. This is definitely personal.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-22.wav|Sounds like he wanted it to change her mind about the hanged man. This is definitely personal.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-58.wav|He does not sound very convinced anymore.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AFTER TALKING TO KLAASJE-107.wav|He wanted her to see the man for what he was. Now that you know, you might wanna lay off this topic, or else you might antagonize him.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-238.wav|Good. I like this. This guy is learning.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-466.wav|Still, after all this headache...
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-502.wav|A little too far there, but you're definitely right.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  RHETORIC WC-515.wav|What just happened between these two?
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA ORB  hardie volition afterthought-13.wav|See, even he acknowledges that it's a good reason!
wavs/Suggestion-KIM SWITCH  TRIED SHOOTING YOURSELF-25.wav|This was your chance to make amends, but you chose not to. Instead you chose to be the bad-ass suicide boiadeiro and now he doesn't like you.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-136.wav|You didn't break this wagon fort, but you did manage to rattle the people inside a bit.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-214.wav|No, the thunder is his. Leave it to the lieutenant.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-229.wav|He seems genuinely surprised at your response. In a good way.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1   HARDIE WC MODIFIERES-238.wav|Finally, you got something out of him. This could prove useful in the future.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-314.wav|What are you talking about? Don't say that, this is no time to nitpick.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-331.wav|Just don't antagonize him, you have this already.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-401.wav|What's with all the silences? It's like these guys don't know how to feel about this. You should keep picking at it...
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-415.wav|He really went out of his way to seem comfortable with this topic. That's all you're gonna get for now.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HARDIE AUTHORITY WC-420.wav|Okay, this turned out better than expected.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-137.wav|That's probably for the best. Don't break your stride now.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-246.wav|So this is why Shanky doesn't like her. Useful for you, it makes him advocate against Ruby.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-296.wav|The big one. Get this and they'll give her to you. Remember, don't piss him off. That never works.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-589.wav|You don't know. Just be honest.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-649.wav|He probably just doesn't like her.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  LOGIC WHITE CHECK-672.wav|You were warned not to bring it up. Your best shot here is to just back out of it.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-639.wav|Try it on Evrart!
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART-644.wav|Summon a smile on your face. A big shit eating grin like his.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  EASY-LEO-321.wav|Oil for the wheels. Much needed in stressful times like these.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  EVRART MURDER-479.wav|There is no way to sway this man in any direction. He is un-suggestable and un-swayable. Just tell the truth.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  RICH GUY CONTAINER DOOR-55.wav|A tough nut to crack, for sure. But the strongest containers often have the softest hearts.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-187.wav|These ultraliberal types love losing huge sums of money on ludicrous proposals. Ergo, you should come up with a plan that's TOTALLY dead in the water.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-196.wav|Steal the Union boss's idea, add a twist, and present it as your own? Very capitalistic!
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-355.wav|Who'd have thought you'd remember that nugget of wisdom after nearly frying your brain like you have?
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  LIGHT BENDING GUY-494.wav|Okay. Well. Maybe I was wrong. We've all learned something today.
wavs/Suggestion-CONTAINERYARD  JOYCE-7.wav|Whoa... that's so nice of him. Suspiciously nice.
wavs/Suggestion-PLAZA  THE GARDENER-340.wav|He didn't think you were about to bust a case.
wavs/Suggestion-DOOMED  RADIOCOMPUTER-433.wav|You should ask her for a hint.
wavs/Suggestion-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-111.wav|That's a stone for leaders.
wavs/Suggestion-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-842.wav|Sounds like she really didn't like those girls.
wavs/Suggestion-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-900.wav|This person means you, or no one else, absolutely no harm. She will answer freely and honestly.
wavs/Suggestion-DOOMED  DICEMAKER-939.wav|Plaisance is not going to like what you have to tell her.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-112.wav|She's merely agreeing with you to reach the conclusion of this conversation faster.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  HORSE FACED WOMAN-160.wav|...after all you've done, is what her tone implies.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  MAN WITH SUNGLASSES-258.wav|Don't even try to win him over. You won't.
wavs/Suggestion-BOARDWALK  PAYPHONE-389.wav|He does not seem to be overly thankful of your kindness as he hangs up.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  MORELL-113.wav|He seems reluctant to talk about himself, but he'll open up, if you prod a little.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  MORELL-495.wav|Not a big fan of scepticism, this one.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  MORELL-606.wav|More than some. He admires this about her.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  GARY-148.wav|He's thinking of a way to gain some advantage from his embarrassing situation.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  GARY-218.wav|You're a simple cop asking a simple question. He can't beat around the bush much longer.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  GARY-746.wav|He winks at you, trying to relay some hidden message. Inviting you to mispronounce it too perhaps? It's odd.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  MORELL CRYPTIDS-120.wav|Yes. Back to cryptozoology. You don't want to sow disagreement between friends.
wavs/Suggestion-WESTCOAST  MORELL CRYPTIDS-182.wav|Now the man feels embarrassed. Time to move on perhaps?
wavs/Suggestion-BOARDWALK  THE PIGS-102.wav|There has to be a way to resolve this situation peacefully.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-92.wav|There is the tiniest bit of flattery in there, the way her eyes move from your shoulder to shoulder.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-627.wav|Or an admirer?
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-783.wav|She did promise she'd be here at night if you don't arrest her... Good girl.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE MAIN-925.wav|No one likes to talk about their dirty laundry and their empty bottles. Maybe if you phrase it emotionally...
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F2  MEDICINE CABINET-168.wav|Be honest. He's not grilling you, he just wants to know. Ask if he's ever wanted to take it too.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  CLEAR WINDOW VISCAL DIFFICULT-270.wav|He is trying to justify it to himself.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-342.wav|Could that have been part of the reason they hanged him?
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-354.wav|Don't be tactful. She doesn't care.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-591.wav|She likes you. The Crownhead is a boring condom. He's jealous. This is human nature.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE RAPE VOLITION-737.wav|She's a glib girl, but she liked the wording.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-81.wav|She clearly enjoys siding with you.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-87.wav|She clearly enjoys telling you this.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-104.wav|There is a small measure of pride in her. That she could quell the rage in such a being.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-566.wav|There is a small measure of pride in her about this. That she could comfort and quell the rage in such a being.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-610.wav|She clearly enjoys siding with you.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE TAPE LELY-611.wav|She clearly enjoyed saying that to you.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-287.wav|What are you trying to be, tactful? She wouldn't mind. Go on then...
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-289.wav|Still, there is something there. She won't tell you now.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-566.wav|Try not to sweat so profusely in her presence too. You'll blow your chances.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F3  KLAASJE FULL STORY-1004.wav|Of course. This case takes precedence.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-404.wav|For a moment, his antipathy is overcome by compassion for the sheer smallness of the money.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-590.wav|There may be some way to get a drink out of him (even for you) but this is not it.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-633.wav|There may be some way to get a drink out of him (even for you) but this is not it.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE-661.wav|Now is not a good time to ask him about the corpse-fridge.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-167.wav|Whatever he may feel about you, he can't miss the opportunity to throw you a look of what he assumes is shared understanding. Go with it.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-221.wav|He's not sorry about his behaviour for your sake. Now that you have money, he really wants to make sure you're not angry with him.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-273.wav|He's not sorry about his behaviour for your sake. Now that you have money, he really wants to make sure you're not angry with him.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-345.wav|You've really worn down his patience. Even paying him didn't help!
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-346.wav|You've really worn down his patience. Even paying him didn't help!
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-521.wav|For a moment, his antipathy is overcome by compassion for the sheer smallness of the money.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-626.wav|Wait, why don't you have a song?! Way to fuck it up! Better to try this line of questioning again after you've found the tape.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-650.wav|Well, well, bringing him that new bird sure made a difference in his attitude.
wavs/Suggestion-WHIRLING F1  GARTE MAIN-1018.wav|Sounds like he cares about the place. He's not going to be overjoyed to hear that it's part of the Doomed Commercial Area.
